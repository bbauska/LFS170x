a.	What is Blockchain
Blockchain is a peer-to-peer ledger system that allows peers to transact directly with each other eliminating the need for a central authority.
At its core, blockchain is a system for recording information about a transaction in a new decentralized way that makes it difficult or impossible to alter. These transactions are stored on sheets or blocks in a digital ledger that is shared among the participants of the network. Consensus on the transactions, brings the peer-to-peer network into agreement. Once the agreed-upon transactions blocks are recorded in the immutable ledger, trust becomes a fundamental component built into the system.
 
b.	The Early Internet
What started as a DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Project Agency) experiment in decentralized computing communications between two university labs in California in 1970, became the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, INTERNET PROTOCOL SUITE (TCP/IP) developed as a standard in networking protocol or computer communication standards, and it is the backbone of today’s Internet.
With the TCP/IP protocols in place, users had the ability to link hypertext documents in an information system accessible from any node or computer using the TCP/IP protocol. The resulting information system or database is today’s World Wide Web.
  
With the birth of the World Wide Web, expanded usages of this new technology arose along with expanded business opportunities. Web servers, people who host and store the documents and web browsers, companies set up to help you view linked documents, help create a household need for this technology and the Internet explosion began.
The Growth of the Internet
The Internet can be grouped into three distinct segments characterized by the way people interact with this new technology.
•	Web 1.0 - Internet of Connection
•	Web 2.0 - Internet of Information
•	Web 3.0 - Internet of Value
Let’s discuss them in more detail.
Web 1.0 - Internet of Connection
Characteristics of Web 1.0:
•	Development of a host of web-based applications, which fostered in online services, such as email.
•	Content from administrator.
•	Managed by a central authority.
•	Read-only, information was “pushed” to users.
•	Email was the first widely adopted application on the Internet.
 
 
Email, Electronically Transferring Information
Computers and items for connection became necessities. Technology advancements in computers brought on changes, floppy disks became hard drives that stored MB that turned into GB that turned into TB. Internet speeds switched from kilobits to tens of megabits per second, to gigabits per second and RAM grew from hundreds of kilobytes to gigabytes and the dot-com bubble began. Companies appeared attempting to cash in on this new technology, most notable was a company called Netscape which developed the first commercial Web browser.
 
Web 2.0 - Internet of Information
Characteristics of Web 2.0:
User-generated content.
Read-write, individuals can interact with information.
Information became siloed.
Data became a commodity.
Web 2.0 saw emerging marketplaces that brought together unrelated buyers and sellers in a seamless low-cost way. Data became a commodity collected, siloed and sold; we were giving up our information at a frenzied pace. Websites let users generate content, social networks became part of our lives.
 
 
Social Networking
Real World Examples of File Sharing
Use Case: Music Sharing Companies
 
 
Approach: Music stored on many computers connected peer-to-peer. Napster software supplied its users with a centralized index of all music files and directed users to where these files were located on the connected peers' computers.
Result: The industry cracks down music sharing companies copyright infringement. Napster is forced to take down its index, shutting down the platform.
 
 
Approach: Music stored on many computers connected peer-to-peer. BitTorrent's software was purely decentralized, the files were stored as packet on the peers' computers and when a request was made for a song, the software would find the packet and send it to the user.
Result: The industry cracks down music sharing companies copyright infringement. BitTorrent is asked to shut down their platform. Since they do not control the software once downloaded to a peer, if two computers are running the software sharing can still occur.
Music sharing companies gave us the first glimpse into peer-to-peer networking. Besides copyright infringement, the main challenge for the music sharing companies was file integrity. You could never be sure the file you requested was the file you would get and there was no one to complain to. Both Napster and BitTorrent are operating today, with different business models.
Web 3.0 - Internet of Value
Characteristics of Web 3.0:
•	Community interaction.
•	More connected, open, and intelligent.
•	Distributed ledgers or blockchain technology, smart contracts, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
•	Identity and information will be held by the individual, breaking data silos.
Bitcoin is the first widely accepted application for the Internet of Value (just as email was the first big application for the Internet of Information).
 
Cryptocurrencies, Electronically Transferring Value
The Internet of Value represents a world where value is exchanged at the speed in which information moves today. The Internet is still the basic platform that these new technologies operate from. The new Web 3.0 browsers are being built to help you manage your cryptocurrency, keys, passwords and other blockchain features. Let’s now dive into blockchain basics.
c.	What Is Blockchain?
There's a new technology that has the power to revolutionize how you, businesses, and the world interact!
You've probably heard of it: it's called Blockchain!
But what is it? How does it work? How does it affect you?
Hearing the word "blockchain" is comparable to hearing the word "internet" in the early 90s.
It seemed elusive, like something that wasn't going to impact your daily life.
But here we are, more than 20 years later. Think about how the Internet has transformed businesses, commerce, communication, even music and video.
And that's not even touching on how the Internet has affected you.
We all carry the Internet in our pocket.
We can transfer money at the touch of a button, check the weather, get directions, and even have food delivered to our door.
The next technology to have that kind of impact isn't some of the buzzwords you hear.
It's not big data. It's not artificial intelligence. It's not even social media.
It's BLOCKCHAIN!
Now, let's discuss the vast promise blockchain has for every business, every society, and for everyone listening today.
And let's begin with an example we are all familiar with.
When you attach a file, a Word document, an Excel sheet, a PDF to an email, you aren't sending an original.
You are actually sending the recipient a copy, and that's a great way to move information around.
But it's not so great when it comes to things like money, stocks and bonds, music, loyalty points, intellectual property, tickets to a game or concert.
Then, sending a copy is suddenly a very bad idea.
Let's look at an example.
If I send you tickets to a concert, it's important that I don't send you a copy.
You now own the original asset and I can no longer use or sell those tickets.
Similarly, if I send you $100, it's important that I still don't own the $100, or have the ability to send it to anyone else.
Both of these examples illustrate a double spend problem, and those can be eliminated with blockchain.
So now, in this exciting time in history, every kind of asset, from tickets, to money, to music, can be stored, moved, exchanged, and transacted without an intermediary.
People everywhere can transact peer-to-peer and trust each other by using collaboration and cryptography.
How did we get here, to this place of trust and collaboration?
It began when Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity is still unknown, released a white paper in 2008, introducing a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash known as Bitcoin.
It is here that blockchain technology made its debut.
Even today people believe Bitcoin and blockchain are one and the same.
They are not!
Bitcoin, another alternative currency,  utilize blockchain technology.
While an important one, Bitcoin is only one use case for blockchain.
Blockchain allows people to exchange assets and perform transactions without a third party.
Imagine a world where you don't need intermediaries.
While traditionally we have needed central authorities to trust one another and fulfill contracts, blockchain makes it possible to have our peers guarantee that for us. But how?
Assets, like we've discussed, are no longer stored in a central place, but distributed across a global ledger, using the highest level of cryptography.
When a transaction is conducted, it's posted across tens of thousands of computers around the globe.
These transactions are recorded as blocks.
Let's imagine a sheet of paper that has 25 lines.
When a sheet is filled up with 25 transactions, the block is validated via group consensus.
Once the page has been validated, it is added to a stack of previously validated sheets.
Each sheet on the stack can be assumed to be trustworthy because, once a sheet is validated, it can't be changed.
Because at this point, all the sheets are linked together.
And to link our sheets together, we embed information from the previous sheet of paper into the new, recently validated sheet.
In blockchain, our sheet of paper is equal to a block.
The act of embedding a previous block of information into the current block of information is called chaining, hence, the name blockchain.
In order to compromise or hack a blockchain network, someone would have to gain control of the majority of computers in that network.
This is extremely difficult to do.
There is no longer a single point of failure, and this is what makes blockchain infinitely more secure than what we have today.
Blockchain isn't just for assets, though. It extends to contracts.
These are called Smart Contracts.
And what are they exactly? What they sound like.
A smart contract self-executes and handles enforcement, the management, and performance of agreements between people.
Examples of smart contracts include insurance policies, copyrighted content, escrow and lending, wills, and trusts.
Smart contracts will revolutionize how we do business.
There are so many possibilities with blockchain; not just in the now, but with things we haven't begun to think about yet.
Blockchain Is NOT Bitcoin
Bitcoin is a digital currency running on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. We will develop the concept of cryptocurrencies in later sections. Bitcoin has no borders and was created as a decentralized payment system, an alternative to currencies issued by governments. Let us look at what it means to be a currency.
  
 Purpose of currency:
•	Medium for exchange
•	Store of value over time
•	Accepted as a measure of worth
According to Investopedia, “Fiat currency is money a government issues that is not backed by a commodity like gold. Fiat money is backed by the government and it has value because the government says so and the citizens believe it. The dollar is an example of the United States fiat currency”.
  
Apart from the government issuing Fiat, a centralized authority needs to keep track of assets. Banks, credit card companies’ stockbrokers are companies that represent a centralized authority that controls your money.

 
Bitcoin is transacted over the Bitcoin network, which is an open, public blockchain network. If you have an Internet connection and a Bitcoin wallet application, you can receive and send the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have value because it can be proven with math. Unlike banks offering centralized services, you are responsible for your cryptocurrency.
  
Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are great use cases for blockchain, but they are just one component of the technology. Some privately run blockchains do not use cryptocurrencies as a function of their blockchains. Blockchain technology can easily transfer anything from property rights, stocks, and even artwork. There are many more use cases that utilize blockchain technology far reaching than currency transfer.
 
c.	Blockchain - Let’s Cover the Basics
In this section, we're gonna talk about what blockchain is: a real simple introduction to the basic concepts and principles behind blockchain.
When you hear about blockchain, you probably think of new, high-emerging tech.
Well, really, all blockchain is, is a combination of technologies that have existed for a long time.
They're simply combined in a new and creative way to give us an amazing new platform on which we can start to build solutions.
Blockchains are often referred to as digital decentralized ledgers.
And when you think of that, all you can think of is something we're all familiar with: a simple notebook.
When we talk about blocks and blockchain, all we're really talking about is a page of data.
We fill up this page with any kind of data imaginable, and, while most of the time today, we're talking about recording financial transactions on this page, or this ledger, or this block, we can record any kind of data we want.
In fact, you can think of a block as being exactly like this piece of paper, in that the paper doesn't know or care what kind of information you're recording on it.
And just like the paper doesn't know or care, neither does the block in a blockchain.
So, while most of what we're recording today are financial transactions, we could also record things like voting records and results, land titling, medical records, or even the opening notes to a Beethoven symphony.
What makes this blockchain notebook incredibly powerful is that all the pages are linked together.
So that if I go back and try and change any data on any page anywhere in this notebook, I break a link in a very obvious and easy-to-determine way.
This gives blockchain a key property known as immutability.
And it's what gives blockchain the security that we've come to know and depend on.
Blockchains also give us an incredible technology called smart contracts, which allow us to programmatically define the rules and steps that should be performed any time a certain type of event is recorded in our blockchain or in our magic notebook.
So, when you think about blockchain, don't get intimidated thinking it's something high tech, and new, and cutting-edge.
It's simply a new and creative way of combining old ideas together to give us an incredible new solutions platform.
And the rest of this series will take a deeper dive into these basic concepts and principles, but if the idea of this unchangeable linked notebook makes sense, congratulations!
You already understand all the major principles and concepts required to understand what blockchain is and why it's so powerful.
Let’s Review an Analogy
A block on a blockchain can be thought of much like a page in a notebook. Data is stored on a block, just like data is written on a page of a notebook. Similar to a sheet of paper, the digital ledger doesn't care what kind of information you're putting on it. So, while most of what we're recording today are financial transactions, we could also record things like voting records and results, land titling and medical records, etc. What makes this blockchain notebook incredibly powerful is that all the pages are linked together. So that if you go back and try and change any data on any page anywhere in this notebook, you break a link in a very obvious and easy-to-determine way.
 
Let’s Review an Analogy: Data Stored
Any data can be stored on the same block. Examples of stored data include:
•	Medical records
•	Property agreements
•	Voting
 
Let’s Review an Analogy: Blocks Are Chained Together
Each block is chained or tied to the previous block by embedding the block with information from the previous block (we will go through this in depth later in the course).
 
Let’s Review an Analogy: Blockchain Is Immutable
If the data is tampered with anywhere in the chain, the links will break in a very obvious way:
 
This provides immutability and security.
Blockchain Features
Blockchain is a combination of several other underlying technologies that have never been combined so successfully. Here are some features that make this new technology so revolutionary.
 
Blockchain Features: Distributed Ledger
A ledger is a collection of transactions. It is not a collection of assets. Assets are part of a transaction, but the ledger records the transaction. With a digitally distributed ledger or a blockchain, no one owns the ledger. The ledger is distributed among participants in the network, all running the same blockchain protocols. It is decentralized in that an identical copy of the ledger exists on every node/computer on the network. In 2009 with the publishing of Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” , Bitcoin became the first application to leverage blockchain technology by recording the first asset transfer on a public blockchain ledger.
Blockchain Features: Peer to Peer Network
The ledger is stored, updated, and maintained by a peer network. Nodes form the infrastructure of a blockchain network. They store, spread and preserve the blockchain data, so a blockchain exists on nodes. All nodes on a network follow the same rules of operation or protocols, but nodes have different roles. A full node contains a copy of the blockchain protocol, transaction history of the blockchain and aids in the maintenance of the blockchain. User node interacts with the ledger. With blockchain technology, a lack of a centralized authority is replaced with a peer-to-peer network.
  
Blockchain networks can be public or private. A public blockchain is open to anyone with an internet connection and the appropriate application. A private blockchain grants access and rights to its users before they can interact.
Blockchain Features: Transparency
In a blockchain, we can see all the transactions that have occurred on the shared or distributed ledger. A blockchain stores details of every transaction that occurred since the first transfer. This first transfer, along with some system information that we will discuss later, becomes the first block in our chain and is referred to as the genesis block. Since every node shares a copy of the agreed-upon ledger, there is no friction about the transactions, everyone has the same agreed-upon copy. Centralized systems are not transparent, the information about the ledger is controlled by one authority.
Blockchain Features: Consensus
Blockchain ledgers are different from centralized ledgers because network participants have an agreement upon what is in the identical ledger. In order for the blocks to be added, all the nodes in the system come to agree as to what transactions are accurate and should be added to the chain of blocks. Since there is no central authority telling the nodes which transactions are valid, a new way to reach agreement or come to consensus is needed.
 
The way in which each blockchain comes to consensus is built into the protocol, they are the rules built into the code that determine how the nodes will add ledger transactions. The Bitcoin network uses a proof of work consensus model. This process of building agreement among a group of mutually distrusting participants is a benefit of blockchain consensus.
Blockchain Features: Encryption
Encryption and cryptography are combined with blockchain technology to assure the information on the blockchain is authentic. In our previous real-world example, the music sharing companies not only had legal issues from copyright infringement, they also could not solve the data integrity problem. Music downloaded from these platforms was only as reliable as the anonymous person storing and sending it. The data had no integrity. Cryptography and blockchain offer a secure way to prove something is authentic. Instead of relying on third-party, trust is put into cryptographic algorithms that prove the provenance and authenticity of an attestation.
Blockchain Features: Programable
Some blockchains offer an additional feature, smart contracts, that impose logic into the system. If you think of the Bitcoin blockchain as a calculator recording financial transactions, you can think of these blockchains as computers. The first of these blockchains is Ethereum, created by Vitalik Buterin, Joe Lubin and team. Ethereum runs the EVM, Ethereum Virtual Machine, which has the ability to impose digital agreements or smart contracts. A smart contract is a program that runs on a blockchain that can impose contractual agreements. Typically, they work as digital agreements that enforce a specific set of rules. These rules are predefined by computer code, which is replicated and executed by all network nodes. Blockchain smart contracts allow for the creation of trustless protocols. This means that two parties can make commitments via blockchain, without having to know or trust each other. They can be sure that if the conditions aren't fulfilled, the contract won't be executed. Other than that, the use of smart contracts can remove the need for intermediaries, reducing operational costs significantly.
d. Blockchain Actors
With new technology comes new opportunities and this holds true for blockchain. As this nascent technology matures, more positions are needed to fill this increased demand. A few of these new positions are listed here:
Entry Level and Internship Positions
Mentorship programs and internships include assisting in the designing and developing blockchain distributed ledgers based on both public and private or permissioned blockchains. With open-source, development and success depend on an active community, Working Groups and Hackatons are available for the newcomer. Skills include basic blockchain knowledge and some familiarity with basic programming languages.
Blockchain Architect
For a blockchain solution to be functional, it first needs to exist. The blockchain architect is the person or group who designs and implements the backend code of the blockchain. The blockchain architect works with blockchain engineers and technical leaders to identify the blockchain structure for specific use cases. Architects understand consensus mechanisms, cryptography systems, key management techniques and smart contract management. Qualifications include Go, Java, Javascript, or any modern programming language plus project management skills.
Blockchain Developer
Developers design, write and upload smart contracts to the blockchain. Developer design workflows that operate with blockchains and smart contracts. Responsibilities can include project design, smart contract development and implementation, front end applications design and application deployment. Skills a developer needs can include Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Studio, .NET, MVC, AJAX, SQL, C, Python, Solidity, C++, C#, Javascript, Node.js, JQuery, SOAP, REST, FTP, HTML, XML, XSLT, XCOD, Neural-networks, Regression, Agile Scrum, MYSQL. Solutions are developed for Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum, Quorum Ripple, Corda and other distributed ledger solutions.
Blockchain Operator
Once the blockchain solution is designed and built, operators can join to create the peer network mentioned previously. The role of operators (nodes) is to store copies of the ledger and keep their copy up to date by distributing transactions and new blocks throughout their network via peer-to-peer communications.
Blockchain Regulator
Many businesses operate under regulations regarding how their data should be stored and processed. This is the same for blockchain solutions. Regulators rarely interact with the blockchain directly, rather oversee regulatory requirements that need to be considered in blockchain development. With governments researching Central Bank Digital Currencies, governing these blockchains will become increasingly more complex.
Blockchain Project Managers
Project managers are the first persons in an organization who are contacted when a company wants to bring blockchain in house and adapt it to their technology platforms. Responsibilities include deciding if a blockchain solution is a good fit for a business situation. If the decision is to move forward, Project Managers would organize key players and resources needed to execute the blockchain project.
Data Storage and Processing Managers
The blockchain provides distributed, immutable storage with built-in integrity checking, but certain limitations exist that have to be managed. Data decisions need to be made dealing with maximum capacity based on the standard block size and block rate. Policies need to address how to provide integrity verification for large amounts of data, should data be stored off-chain with a hash of the data stored on-chain. eMembers of the peer network must execute the code to remain in sync with the current state of the network. If smart contracts commonly require large amounts of processing power to complete, devices external to the peer network may be used to augment the processing power of the network.
Blockchain Data Scientists
Blockchain has the ability to collect large amounts of data. The Blockchain Data Scientist collects, interprets, analyzes and manages data. Developing algorithms that can analyze patterns in large data sets, the data scientist provides insight into the data collected.
Blockchain Quality Engineer
This position is responsible for ensuring quality in all areas of blockchain development, such as automation frameworks and tests, manual testing and dashboards to support mobile, web and platform engineering. A quality engineer will need to research and advise on blockchain tools and develop quality assurance (QA) automated test standards, as well as define, write and implement test automation strategies for load performance tests. Applicants may also need an engineering management MBA degree.
Blockchain Legal Consultant or Attorney
A blockchain legal consultant is responsible for advising companies on how to structure blockchain endeavors. Advise on how to structure and govern initial coin offerings, some of which are now coming under greater regulatory scrutiny. Attorneys will also be tasked with developing legal partnerships and contracts as blockchain technology offers "smart contracts", which are self-executing based on previously agreed terms. Duties can include designing legal partnerships that would connect the crypto ecosystem with existing financial structures, and supporting various merger-and-acquisition activities, such as negotiating and drafting legal agreements and performing due diligence on blockchain projects.
Blockchain Web Designer
A decentralized community needs to keep the community that supports it informed. When including the use of cryptocurrencies in your business and when launching blockchains, there will be a greater need for websites to inform customers what a company is offering. A blockchain web designer will need to come up with original concepts, creative graphics and "mind blowing" user interfaces and dashboards to engage a diverse and inclusive community.
Blockchain Consultants
Blockchain consulting companies and blockchain consultants are tasked with advising companies on designing and implementing blockchain solutions. This includes the documentation and maintenance of solutions, as well as their initial implementations.
NFT Graphics Designer
NFT stands for a non fungible token, a special token that represents a unique ID that is linked to a piece of crypto art that cannot be replicated and is used to verify ownership of a piece. The collectable world is jumping in head first and creating non fungible tokens that represent art, music, memorializing events, newspaper articles and record releases. Designers are needed to turn these moments/media into art for the thirsty NFT market.
e. Who Is Using Blockchain?
There are a lot of really interesting use cases being explored with blockchain right now.
When you first get into blockchain, one of the areas you'll see people immediately jump to are healthcare, how can we manage our personal health information on the blockchain, and voting an election reform, and both of these are really, really interesting ideas.
The goal behind the folks looking at blockchain for healthcare is the idea that it would be great if your medical records could be accessible with your permission to anyone else, anywhere on the planet.
So, if you're halfway across the world on vacation and you fall ill and end up in a hospital, wouldn't it be great if the doctor treating you had full insight into your medical records, knew any allergies you had, or knew any prescriptions that you were already on?
So, that's a very, very big area, and this ties a lot into blockchain and Identity Management.
How do we safely identify and protect people's personal data on blockchain?
So, a lot of interesting challenges there that are being worked out...
Blockchain for voting and election reform is a big topic right now, especially with all the conversation lately about how do we ensure the integrity of elections and demonstrate that our results haven't been tampered with or altered.
This is an area where blockchain could add a lot of value.
And then, of course, we hear a lot about traditional use cases, areas that are getting a lot of traction in blockchain right now.
Probably one of the biggest are supply chain, value chain relationships, which are very, very common in today's economy.
We have very, very few products or services that are offered completely and solely by one organization, without the involvement of other vendors, partners, suppliers, manufacturers, third-party organizations, etc.
So, blockchain to track the supply, the origin of the goods and services that we consume is a big use case.
Walmart is really pioneering this right now with a blockchain solution that they're using to identify the provenance of meat, where does the meat that is sold in a Walmart store come from, and the ultimate goal here is that, when we do have contaminated foods, and we have to issue a recall, currently, because we just don't have good insight into that supply chain, we recall and destroy a lot more food than we really need to, which is tremendously wasteful, especially with all the people on the planet that we could be giving that good food to.
So, these are some real, real exciting areas that we see being pursued in blockchain right now.
On the public sector, there's a lot of interest in blockchain for law enforcement purposes.
How do we allow different law enforcement agencies at the federal, state, county, city level, all to share data seamlessly, in a safe, secure fashion, which also protects people's personal privacy and anonymity, when appropriate.
Another area where blockchain is getting explored and is generating a lot of excitement is with artists, with people who produce content.
So, if you're an author, if you're a musician, if you're an artist, traditionally, you've only been able to get your work out to the public, in the hands of the public, by going through a third-party intermediary.
So, if I'm an author, traditionally, the only way I've been able to share my creation with the general public has been going to a publishing company and getting my works published.
Blockchain enables lots of interesting scenarios where I can sell that work directly to consumers, create new subscription models, and this is having very interesting effects on the work itself.
One of the things we're seeing is that traditional book publishing, there's anywhere between 12 to 18 months delay between when the author finishes the last word of a book and when it actually ends up into the consumers hands.
Well, if we can use blockchain to enable consumers to purchase this material or subscribe directly to the content creator, we take that lag time completely out of it.
And this allows authors and content creators to do some really interesting things.
You could write a fictional story and have one of your characters respond real-time to a news story that actually happened last week.
It makes for very compelling reading and it's just something we're not able to do today in the traditional publishing world because of that delay.
We also see a lot of interest in blockchain for fractional asset ownership scenarios.
So, we know we're 10-15 years away from having self-driving cars be a very regular thing, and when we all get our own self-driving car, if we're smart, we're gonna have that car take us to work and then turn around and perform ride-sharing services throughout the day, when we're not using it, in order to recoup some of that investment.
Well, in a blockchain world with coins and tokens, we can fractionalize that asset ownership, and I can take that same money I used to buy one self-driving car which operates in one city, and I could buy one percent of a hundred self-driving cars in the hundred's biggest cities on the planet.
And so, if they're ever weather conditions, where maybe my car couldn't operate locally, that's okay.
I have a much more diversified investment, which continues to offer returns, because I have a virtual guarantee that any major city that I have one percent of my car ownership in is currently in rush-hour right now, in peak times of people needing a ride.
So, there are lots of very very interesting use cases for blockchain in the real world right now.
I would encourage all of you to dig in a little bit more, and see some of the interesting things that are going on with blockchain in healthcare, in public sector, in insurance, in supply chain, value chain and more, see what other folks are doing, and then go out and make your own blockchain dreams a reality.
Blockchain Users: Business to Consumer (B2C)
A Business to Consumer (B2C) is business or transactions conducted directly between a company and consumers who are the end-users of its products or services. Services being provided to the consumer is an area of interest to companies. Benefits to the consumer are transparency to the consumer, accountability from suppliers, ethical sourcing validation, labor verification and an immutable shared view.
  
Vertical markets see the advantage to the transparency feature in blockchain. Financials, logistics, charity funding, agriculture and ethical sourcing tracking are all markets leveraging blockchain to offer new insights to the customer.
Real World Example of Supply Chain Business to Consumer
Use Case: Diamond Tracing
 
 
 Approach: The blockchain collaboration, known as TrustChainTM, will track and authenticate diamonds, precious metals and jewelry at all stages of the global supply chain, from the mine to the retailer/consumer.
Result: The jewelry industry can now track and authenticate diamonds and precious metals through every stage of the supply chain. Blockchain provides physical product verification, process verification and servers as an ethical oversight.
Blockchain Users: Business to Business (B2B)
With a decentralized approach, blockchain removes the middleman (such as banks and brokers) to facilitate faster and less expensive payments. The shared ledger approach also eliminates the need for multiple paper copies that need to be verified and updated frequently.
 
Industries like finance, international trade and commerce, food supply chains are taking a serious look at blockchain.
Real World Example of Business to Business Transaction
Use Case: Multi-party Invoicing DLT Labs
 
•	Approach: DLT Labs along with Walmart Canada initiated a tracking program tackling the enormous problem in the freight and shipping industry of dispute resolution in disparate invoicing systems. The solution connects all points on the supply chain with a shared trusted ledger. This eliminates the root problems that cause invoice disputes. The carriers are a vital link in Walmart's supply chain backbone, and the DLT solution ensures invoicing systems run smoothly.
•	Result: Demonstrable transformation of freight management and carrier relationships by implementing a shared DLT invoicing system with trust and transparency build-in, reduces disputes among organization by 95%.
Unintended Use Cases
One of the coolest things about blockchain is some of the unintended consequences a good blockchain solution might have.
Let's look at an example.
Right now, there is a lot of attention being given to how blockchain might be used, in general, for supply chain relationships and, specifically, in the food supply chain.
Let's pretend that you have a very young child and your child has a serious pesticide allergy.
So, of course, when you go to the grocery store, you make sure that you only buy the produce in the produce section that has the USDA organic label.
It's just a little sticker that goes on the produce.
So, you buy your produce and you stand in the checkout line, and you feel pretty good that the produce you're buying actually is organic and has been treated with all-natural pesticides, and won't make your young child sick.
But sometimes you wonder, standing in line, how do I really know? How do I really know that someone didn't just print up a bunch of these stickers in their basement and apply them at the last minute?
The blockchain can go a long way to solving that problem and providing much greater insight.
Let's say, you're standing in the grocery store one day, and instead of the easily forged stickers, you're able to pull out your phone and scan a QR code.
When you scan that QR code, instantly on your phone the entire lifecycle of that piece of produce pops up.
You can see the date that it was planted on the orchard.
You can see after it was planted that an organic pesticide company came along and treated it with an all-natural pesticide.
You can even verify that the pesticide is natural by seeing the ingredient list in that pesticide.
And finally, you may see who actually delivered that produce to the store.
Let's say that there's a new green electric trucking company out there - Ed's Electric Trucking.
Ed has seen all the fancy new Tesla semis. He thinks they're great and he is committed to providing a transportation and logistics company which is also environmentally friendly.
Now, in today's world, you don't have a way of knowing about someone like Ed and his electric trucking company.
There just aren't good ways for folks in the B2B space to communicate their business value directly to consumers.
This is an interesting potential byproduct of using blockchain and smart contracts as a business solution.
Not only would I, as a consumer, have greater insight into the origin of that produce and feel much better standing in the checkout line, but maybe what Ed's doing resonates with me personally.
Maybe I'm a very green-conscious consumer.
I didn't know there was such an organization as Ed's.
And I have to buy a few more things while I'm at the store, besides produce. I have to buy some deodorant, some shaving cream, and some laundry detergent.
So, when I buy that deodorant, shaving cream, laundry detergent, I only buy the ones that were delivered by Ed's Electric Trucking.
This gives Ed and other B2B players a new and exciting way to establish brand and gain mindshare with the consumer that they currently don't have.
Certainly, it was not the original problem we went to solve with blockchain, but many times, when we apply blockchain to a real-world problem, we find out there are a lot of unexpected benefits just like this.
So, look for blockchain not just to transform the areas that we're aware it might make a difference in, but also to provide some new exciting and unintended benefits.
Blockchain Users: Government to Consumer (G2C)/Government to Government (G2G)
The public sector is the part of the economy composed of both public sector and private sector enterprises that are operating on behalf of the public. It is the business of taking care of the people. Public sector includes all government, military, police, public health and welfare, infrastructure, etc. Public sector organizations leverage blockchain technology to move away from siloed and inefficient centralized systems. Current systems are inherently insecure and costly, with duplicated and in-efficient workflows. Blockchain networks offer more secure, agile, and cost-effective structures.
 
Dubai Use Case
So, when people first start getting into blockchain, one of the areas they really start to look at is where is blockchain being used in the real world, what examples do we have of a blockchain being deployed and at what scale.
And there's really no better example of this right now than what's going on in Dubai.
Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, is piloting a very ambitious program called smart Dubai 2021.
And what Smart Dubai 2021 aims to do is to move all governmental operations and record-keeping on the blockchain by the year 2021.
The goals of this program are increased transparency in the government operations, increased efficiency, and by proxy, providing better service to city residents and constituents and establishing Dubai as a thought leader, an industry leader in the blockchain space.
There are lots of really cool applications that tie into this.
Blockchain is becoming the enabling layer for a lot of other Smart Dubai initiatives around creating a smart city.
So, projects like automated traffic signals, registration of citizens for governmental services, etc. are all being pioneered on blockchain.
So, if you want to see some of the really exciting use cases in blockchain right now, be sure to check out Dubai and what's going on with their Smart Dubai 2021 initiative.
Real World Example of Public Sector Government to Government/Citizens
Use Case: Public Sector - Smart Dubai
 
•	Approach: To make Dubai the happiest city on Earth by recreating everyday experiences for residents and visitors of Dubai, making them more personalized seamless, efficient and impactful. The Smart Dubai strategy will be using three essential pillars: government efficiency, industry creation and international leadership
•	Result: By the end of 2021, Dubai government will go completely paper-free, eliminating more than one billion pieces of paper used for government transactions every day. When successful, Dubai will be the first blockchain-powered government driving the future economy.
More Use Cases
Blockchain is having far reaching effects in major industries. Let’s take a look at three major industries having a positive influence from this new way to organize our information:
•	Supply chain
Blockchain is used in supply chains to gain transparency and traceability. This has a special advantage for global health when used in traceability to the food supply chain. By tracking food on a blockchain, you are building trust into the system through the transparency feature. In the event of a problem, blockchain technology can pinpoint the exact location and cause of a food health issue. By instantly tracing food issues back to the source, all contaminated lots can be tracked and dealt with instantly.
•	Global trade
Blockchain is making headway in the global trade markets with transparency and immutability that offer new relationships among distrusting parties. Blockchain makes sure all relevant parties have access to the same information. Trade barriers are reduced, from settlement issues, to compliance and regulation, information is being shared and accessed in new secure ways. A distributed ledger technology (DLT) opens up a new avenue for securely sharing data that guarantees accuracy while removing banks as deal facilitators. Smart contract and microfinancing alternatives allow all size companies to seamlessly trade across borders.
•	Digital identity (self-sovereign identity and verifiable credentials)
Users of the Internet were all but unaware that all the information given so freely when interacting with companies online, was being stored and sold. Data became a siloed commodity owned by everyone but you. With new blockchain technology, individuals can reclaim their identity information breaking the need for data silos, endless passwords and hackable databases. Self-sovereign identity (an individual identity holder controls their credentials and can use them without permission) gives secure identity verification designed to bring trust and personal control so people can prove things about themselves using trustworthy verifiable digital credential.
