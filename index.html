</span>What is Blockchain</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain is a peer-to-peer ledger system that allows peers
to transact directly with each other eliminating the need for a central
authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At its core, blockchain is a system for recording
information about a transaction in a new decentralized way that makes it
difficult or impossible to alter. These transactions are stored on sheets or
blocks in a digital ledger that is shared among the participants of the
network. Consensus on the transactions, brings the peer-to-peer network into
agreement. Once the agreed-upon transactions blocks are recorded in the
immutable ledger, trust becomes a fundamental component built into the system.</p>

</span>The Early Internet</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>What started as a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.darpa.mil/"

experiment in decentralized computing communications between two university
labs in California in 1970, became the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol, INTERNET PROTOCOL SUITE (TCP/IP) developed as a standard in
networking protocol or computer communication standards, and it is the backbone
of today’s Internet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With the TCP/IP protocols in place, users had the ability to
link hypertext documents in an information system accessible from any node or
computer using the TCP/IP protocol. The resulting information system or
database is today’s World Wide Web.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With the birth of the World Wide Web, expanded usages of
this new technology arose along with expanded business opportunities. Web
servers, people who host and store the documents and web browsers, companies
set up to help you view linked documents, help create a household need for this
technology and the Internet explosion began.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Computers and items for connection became necessities.
Technology advancements in computers brought on changes, floppy disks became
hard drives that stored MB that turned into GB that turned into TB. Internet
speeds switched from kilobits to tens of megabits per second, to gigabits per
second and RAM grew from hundreds of kilobytes to gigabytes and the dot-com
bubble began. Companies appeared attempting to cash in on this new technology,
most notable was a company called&nbsp;<a href="https://isp.netscape.com/"
target="_blank"><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;
color:#00688D'>Netscape</span></a>&nbsp;which developed the first commercial

<h2>Web 2.0 - Internet of Information</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Characteristics of Web 2.0:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>User-generated content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Read-write, individuals can interact with information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Information became siloed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Data became a commodity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Web 2.0 saw emerging marketplaces that brought together
unrelated buyers and sellers in a seamless low-cost way. Data became a
commodity collected, siloed and sold; we were giving up our information at a
frenzied pace. Websites let users generate content, social networks became part
of our lives.</p>

<h2>Real World Examples of File Sharing</h2>

src="https://github.com/bbauska/LFS170x-2021/blob/main/images/image007.png?raw=true"
alt="Napster logo"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Approach: Music stored on many computers connected
peer-to-peer.&nbsp;<a href="https://us.napster.com/" target="_blank"><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;color:#00688D'>Napster</span></a>&nbsp;software
supplied its users with a centralized index of all music files and directed
users to where these files were located on the connected peers' computers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Result: The industry cracks down music sharing companies
copyright infringement. Napster is&nbsp;<em><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:#454545'>forced</span></em>&nbsp;to take
down its index, shutting down the platform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"inherit",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=384 height=75 id="image008 - BitTorrent logo"
src="https://github.com/bbauska/LFS170x-2021/blob/main/images/image008.png?raw=true"
alt="BitTorrent logo"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Approach: Music stored on many computers connected
peer-to-peer.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bittorrent.com/" target="_blank"><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;color:#00688D'>BitTorrent</span></a>'s
software was purely decentralized, the files were stored as packet on the
peers' computers and when a request was made for a song, the software would
find the packet and send it to the user.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Result: The industry cracks down music sharing companies
copyright infringement. BitTorrent is&nbsp;<em><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:#454545'>asked</span></em>&nbsp;to shut
down their platform. Since they do not control the software once downloaded to
a peer, if two computers are running the software sharing can still occur.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Music sharing companies gave us the first glimpse into
peer-to-peer networking. Besides copyright infringement, the main challenge for
the music sharing companies was file integrity. You could never be sure the
file you requested was the file you would get and there was no one to complain
to. Both Napster and BitTorrent are operating today, with different business
models.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Cryptocurrencies, Electronically Transferring Value</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Internet of Value represents a world where value is
exchanged at the speed in which information moves today. The Internet is still
the basic platform that these new technologies operate from. The new Web 3.0
browsers are being built to help you manage your cryptocurrency, keys,
passwords and other blockchain features. Let’s now dive into blockchain basics.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:-.25in'>c.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What Is Blockchain?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>There's a new technology that has the power to revolutionize
how you, businesses, and the world interact!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You've probably heard of it: it's called Blockchain!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But what is it? How does it work? How does it affect you?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hearing the word &quot;blockchain&quot; is comparable to
hearing the word &quot;internet&quot; in the early 90s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It seemed elusive, like something that wasn't going to
impact your daily life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But here we are, more than 20 years later. Think about how
the Internet has transformed businesses, commerce, communication, even music
and video.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that's not even touching on how the Internet has
affected you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We all carry the Internet in our pocket.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can transfer money at the touch of a button, check the
weather, get directions, and even have food delivered to our door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next technology to have that kind of impact isn't some
of the buzzwords you hear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's not big data. It's not artificial intelligence. It's
not even social media.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's BLOCKCHAIN!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, let's discuss the vast promise blockchain has for every
business, every society, and for everyone listening today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And let's begin with an example we are all familiar with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you attach a file, a Word document, an Excel sheet, a
PDF to an email, you aren't sending an original.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You are actually sending the recipient a copy, and that's a
great way to move information around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But it's not so great when it comes to things like money,
stocks and bonds, music, loyalty points, intellectual property, tickets to a
game or concert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then, sending a copy is suddenly a very bad idea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's look at an example.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I send you tickets to a concert, it's important that I
don't send you a copy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You now own the original asset and I can no longer use or
sell those tickets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Similarly, if I send you $100, it's important that I still
don't own the $100, or have the ability to send it to anyone else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both of these examples illustrate a double spend problem,
and those can be eliminated with blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So now, in this exciting time in history, every kind of
asset, from tickets, to money, to music, can be stored, moved, exchanged, and
transacted without an intermediary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People everywhere can transact peer-to-peer and trust each
other by using collaboration and cryptography.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How did we get here, to this place of trust and
collaboration?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It began when Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity is still
unknown, released a white paper in 2008, introducing a purely peer-to-peer
version of electronic cash known as Bitcoin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is here that blockchain technology made its debut.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even today people believe Bitcoin and blockchain are one and
the same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They are not!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bitcoin, another alternative currency,  utilize blockchain
technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While an important one, Bitcoin is only one use case for
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain allows people to exchange assets and perform
transactions without a third party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Imagine a world where you don't need intermediaries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While traditionally we have needed central authorities to
trust one another and fulfill contracts, blockchain makes it possible to have
our peers guarantee that for us. But how?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Assets, like we've discussed, are no longer stored in a
central place, but distributed across a global ledger, using the highest level
of cryptography.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a transaction is conducted, it's posted across tens of
thousands of computers around the globe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These transactions are recorded as blocks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's imagine a sheet of paper that has 25 lines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a sheet is filled up with 25 transactions, the block is
validated via group consensus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once the page has been validated, it is added to a stack of
previously validated sheets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each sheet on the stack can be assumed to be trustworthy
because, once a sheet is validated, it can't be changed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because at this point, all the sheets are linked together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And to link our sheets together, we embed information from
the previous sheet of paper into the new, recently validated sheet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In blockchain, our sheet of paper is equal to a block.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The act of embedding a previous block of information into
the current block of information is called chaining, hence, the name
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to compromise or hack a blockchain network, someone
would have to gain control of the majority of computers in that network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is extremely difficult to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is no longer a single point of failure, and this is
what makes blockchain infinitely more secure than what we have today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain isn't just for assets, though. It extends to
contracts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These are called Smart Contracts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And what are they exactly? What they sound like.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A smart contract self-executes and handles enforcement, the
management, and performance of agreements between people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Examples of smart contracts include insurance policies,
copyrighted content, escrow and lending, wills, and trusts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Smart contracts will revolutionize how we do business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are so many possibilities with blockchain; not just in
the now, but with things we haven't begun to think about yet.</p>

<h2>Blockchain Is NOT Bitcoin</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bitcoin is a digital currency running on top of the Bitcoin
blockchain. We will develop the concept of cryptocurrencies in later sections. Bitcoin
has no borders and was created as a decentralized payment system, an
alternative to currencies issued by governments. Let us look at what it means
to be a currency.</p>

</span>Blockchain - Let’s Cover the Basics</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this section, we're gonna talk about what blockchain is:
a real simple introduction to the basic concepts and principles behind
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you hear about blockchain, you probably think of new,
high-emerging tech.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, really, all blockchain is, is a combination of
technologies that have existed for a long time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They're simply combined in a new and creative way to give us
an amazing new platform on which we can start to build solutions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchains are often referred to as digital decentralized
ledgers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And when you think of that, all you can think of is
something we're all familiar with: a simple notebook.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we talk about blocks and blockchain, all we're really
talking about is a page of data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We fill up this page with any kind of data imaginable, and,
while most of the time today, we're talking about recording financial
transactions on this page, or this ledger, or this block, we can record any
kind of data we want.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In fact, you can think of a block as being exactly like this
piece of paper, in that the paper doesn't know or care what kind of information
you're recording on it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And just like the paper doesn't know or care, neither does
the block in a blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, while most of what we're recording today are financial
transactions, we could also record things like voting records and results, land
titling, medical records, or even the opening notes to a Beethoven symphony.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What makes this blockchain notebook incredibly powerful is
that all the pages are linked together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So that if I go back and try and change any data on any page
anywhere in this notebook, I break a link in a very obvious and
easy-to-determine way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This gives blockchain a key property known as immutability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it's what gives blockchain the security that we've come
to know and depend on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchains also give us an incredible technology called
smart contracts, which allow us to programmatically define the rules and steps
that should be performed any time a certain type of event is recorded in our
blockchain or in our magic notebook.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, when you think about blockchain, don't get intimidated
thinking it's something high tech, and new, and cutting-edge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's simply a new and creative way of combining old ideas
together to give us an incredible new solutions platform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the rest of this series will take a deeper dive into
these basic concepts and principles, but if the idea of this unchangeable
linked notebook makes sense, congratulations!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You already understand all the major principles and concepts
required to understand what blockchain is and why it's so powerful.</p>

<h2>Let’s Review an Analogy</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>A block on a blockchain can
be thought of much like a page in a notebook. Data is stored on a block, just
like data is written on a page of a notebook. Similar to a sheet of paper, the
digital ledger doesn't care what kind of information you're putting on it. So,
while most of what we're recording today are financial transactions, we could
also record things like voting records and results, land titling and medical
records, etc. What makes this blockchain notebook incredibly powerful is that
all the pages are linked together. So that if you go back and try and change
any data on any page anywhere in this notebook, you break a link in a very
obvious and easy-to-determine way.</span></p>

<h2>Let’s Review an Analogy: Data Stored</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Any data can be stored on the same block. Examples of stored
data include:</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

alt="Data stored on block"></p>

<h2>Let’s Review an Analogy: Blocks Are Chained Together</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Each block is chained or tied
to the previous block by embedding the block with information from the previous
block (we will go through this in depth later in the course).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0

<h2>Let’s Review an Analogy: Blockchain Is Immutable</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>If the data is tampered with
anywhere in the chain, the links will break in a very obvious way:</span></p>

alt="Blockchain Is Immutable"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>This provides immutability
and security.</span></p>

<h2>Blockchain Features</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Blockchain is a combination
of several other underlying technologies that have never been combined so
successfully. Here are some features that make this new technology so
revolutionary.</span></p>

<h2 align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0 width=384 height=216
id="image019 - Blockchain features"
src="https://github.com/bbauska/LFS170x-2021/blob/main/images/image019.png?raw=true"
alt="Blockchain Features"></h2>

<h2>Blockchain Features: Distributed Ledger</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>A ledger is a collection of
transactions. It is not a collection of assets. Assets are part of a
transaction, but the ledger records the transaction. With a digitally
distributed ledger or a blockchain, no one owns the ledger. The ledger is
distributed among participants in the network, all running the same blockchain
protocols. It is decentralized in that an identical copy of the ledger exists
on every node/computer on the network. In 2009 with the publishing of Satoshi
Nakamoto’s whitepaper&nbsp;</span><a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"
target="_blank"><i><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;
color:#00688D;background:white'>“Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash
System”</span></i></a><span style='background:white'>&nbsp;,&nbsp;</span><a

13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:#00688D;background:white'>Bitcoin</span></a><span
style='background:white'>&nbsp;became the first application to leverage
blockchain technology by recording the first asset transfer on a public
blockchain ledger.</span></p>

<h2>Blockchain Features: Peer to Peer Network</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ledger is stored, updated, and maintained by a peer
network. Nodes form the infrastructure of a blockchain network. They store,
spread and preserve the blockchain data, so a blockchain exists on nodes. All
nodes on a network follow the same rules of operation or protocols, but nodes
have different roles. A full node contains a copy of the blockchain protocol,
transaction history of the blockchain and aids in the maintenance of the
blockchain. User node interacts with the ledger. With blockchain technology, a
lack of a centralized authority is replaced with a peer-to-peer network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=288 height=162 id="image020 - Computers connected"
src="https://github.com/bbauska/LFS170x-2021/blob/main/images/image020.png?raw=true"
alt="Computers connected"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Blockchain networks can
be&nbsp;</span><em><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;
color:#454545;background:white'>public</span></em><span style='background:white'>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><em><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:#454545;
background:white'>private</span></em><span style='background:white'>. A public
blockchain is open to anyone with an internet connection and the appropriate
application. A private blockchain grants access and rights to its users before
they can interact.</span></p>

<h2>Blockchain Features: Transparency</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>In a blockchain, we can see
all the transactions that have occurred on the shared or distributed ledger. A
blockchain stores details of every transaction that occurred since the first
transfer. This first transfer, along with some system information that we will
discuss later, becomes the first block in our chain and is referred to as the
genesis block. Since every node shares a copy of the agreed-upon ledger, there
is no friction about the transactions, everyone has the same agreed-upon copy.
Centralized systems are not transparent, the information about the ledger is
controlled by one authority.</span></p>

<h2>Blockchain Features: Consensus</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Blockchain ledgers are
different from centralized ledgers because network participants have an
agreement upon what is in the identical ledger. In order for the blocks to be
added, all the nodes in the system come to agree as to what transactions are
accurate and should be added to the chain of blocks. Since there is no central
authority telling the nodes which transactions are valid, a new way to reach
agreement or come to&nbsp;</span><em><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:
"Inter",sans-serif;color:#454545;background:white'>consensus</span></em><span
style='background:white'>&nbsp;is needed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=384 height=190 id="image021 - Computer network - all agree to transaction"
src="https://github.com/bbauska/LFS170x-2021/blob/main/images/image021.png?raw=true"
alt="Computer Network - All Agree to Transaction"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>The way in which each
blockchain comes to consensus is built into the protocol, they are the rules
built into the code that determine how the nodes will add ledger transactions.
The Bitcoin network uses a proof of work consensus model. This process of
building agreement among a group of mutually distrusting participants is a
benefit of blockchain consensus.</span></p>

<h2>Blockchain Features: Encryption</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Encryption and cryptography
are combined with blockchain technology to assure the information on the
blockchain is authentic. In our previous real-world example, the music sharing
companies not only had legal issues from copyright infringement, they also
could not solve the data integrity problem. Music downloaded from these
platforms was only as reliable as the anonymous person storing and sending it.
The data had no integrity. Cryptography and blockchain offer a secure way to
prove something is authentic. Instead of relying on third-party, trust is put
into cryptographic algorithms that prove the provenance and authenticity of an
attestation.</span></p>

<h2>Blockchain Features: Programable</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Some blockchains offer an

"Inter",sans-serif;color:#454545;background:white'>smart contracts</span></em><span

by Vitalik Buterin, Joe Lubin and team. Ethereum runs the EVM, Ethereum Virtual
Machine, which has the ability to impose digital agreements or smart contracts.
A smart contract is a program that runs on a blockchain that can impose
contractual agreements. Typically, they work as digital agreements that enforce
a specific set of rules. These rules are predefined by computer code, which is
replicated and executed by all network nodes. Blockchain smart contracts allow
for the creation of trustless protocols. This means that two parties can make
commitments via blockchain, without having to know or trust each other. They
can be sure that if the conditions aren't fulfilled, the contract won't be
executed. Other than that, the use of smart contracts can remove the need for
intermediaries, reducing operational costs significantly.</span></p>

<h2 style='text-indent:-.25in'>d. Blockchain Actors</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>With new technology comes new opportunities and this holds
true for blockchain. As this nascent technology matures, more positions are
needed to fill this increased demand. A few of these new positions are listed
here:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.0pt;
margin-left:0in'><span class=Heading4Char>Entry Level and Internship Positions<br>
</span>Mentorship programs and internships include assisting in the designing
and developing blockchain distributed ledgers based on both public and private
or permissioned blockchains. With open-source, development and success depend
on an active community, Working Groups and Hackatons are available for the
newcomer. Skills include basic blockchain knowledge and some familiarity with
basic programming languages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading4Char>Blockchain Architect<br>
</span>For a blockchain solution to be functional, it first needs to exist. The
blockchain architect is the person or group who designs and implements the
backend code of the blockchain. The blockchain architect works with blockchain
engineers and technical leaders to identify the blockchain structure for
specific use cases. Architects understand consensus mechanisms, cryptography
systems, key management techniques and smart contract management.
Qualifications include Go, Java, Javascript, or any modern programming language
plus project management skills.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading4Char>Blockchain Developer<br>
</span>Developers design, write and upload smart contracts to the blockchain.
Developer design workflows that operate with blockchains and smart contracts.
Responsibilities can include project design, smart contract development and
implementation, front end applications design and application deployment.
Skills a developer needs can include Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Studio, .NET,
MVC, AJAX, SQL, C, Python, Solidity, C++, C#, Javascript, Node.js, JQuery,
SOAP, REST, FTP, HTML, XML, XSLT, XCOD, Neural-networks, Regression, Agile
Scrum, MYSQL. Solutions are developed for Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum, Quorum
Ripple, Corda and other distributed ledger solutions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading4Char>Blockchain Operator<br>
</span>Once the blockchain solution is designed and built, operators can join
to create the peer network mentioned previously. The role of operators (nodes)
is to store copies of the ledger and keep their copy up to date by distributing
transactions and new blocks throughout their network via peer-to-peer
communications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading4Char>Blockchain Regulator<br>
</span>Many businesses operate under regulations regarding how their data
should be stored and processed. This is the same for blockchain solutions.
Regulators rarely interact with the blockchain directly, rather oversee
regulatory requirements that need to be considered in blockchain development.
With governments researching Central Bank Digital Currencies, governing these
blockchains will become increasingly more complex.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading4Char>Blockchain Project Managers<br>
</span>Project managers are the first persons in an organization who are
contacted when a company wants to bring blockchain in house and adapt it to
their technology platforms. Responsibilities include deciding if a blockchain
solution is a good fit for a business situation. If the decision is to move
forward, Project Managers would organize key players and resources needed to
execute the blockchain project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading4Char>Data Storage and Processing
Managers<br>
</span>The blockchain provides distributed, immutable storage with built-in
integrity checking, but certain limitations exist that have to be managed. Data
decisions need to be made dealing with maximum capacity based on the standard
block size and block rate. Policies need to address how to provide integrity
verification for large amounts of data, should data be stored off-chain with a
hash of the data stored on-chain. eMembers of the peer network must execute the
code to remain in sync with the current state of the network. If smart
contracts commonly require large amounts of processing power to complete,
devices external to the peer network may be used to augment the processing
power of the network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading4Char>Blockchain Data Scientists<br>
</span>Blockchain has the ability to collect large amounts of data. The
Blockchain Data Scientist collects, interprets, analyzes and manages data.
Developing algorithms that can analyze patterns in large data sets, the data
scientist provides insight into the data collected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading4Char>Blockchain Quality Engineer<br>
</span>This position is responsible for ensuring quality in all areas of
blockchain development, such as automation frameworks and tests, manual testing
and dashboards to support mobile, web and platform engineering. A quality
engineer will need to research and advise on blockchain tools and develop
quality assurance (QA) automated test standards, as well as define, write and
implement test automation strategies for load performance tests. Applicants may
also need an engineering management MBA degree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading4Char>Blockchain Legal Consultant or
Attorney<br>
</span>A blockchain legal consultant is responsible for advising companies on
how to structure blockchain endeavors. Advise on how to structure and govern
initial coin offerings, some of which are now coming under greater regulatory
scrutiny. Attorneys will also be tasked with developing legal partnerships and
contracts as blockchain technology offers &quot;smart contracts&quot;, which
are self-executing based on previously agreed terms. Duties can include
designing legal partnerships that would connect the crypto ecosystem with
existing financial structures, and supporting various merger-and-acquisition
activities, such as negotiating and drafting legal agreements and performing
due diligence on blockchain projects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading4Char>Blockchain Web Designer<br>
</span>A decentralized community needs to keep the community that supports it
informed. When including the use of cryptocurrencies in your business and when
launching blockchains, there will be a greater need for websites to inform
customers what a company is offering. A blockchain web designer will need to
come up with original concepts, creative graphics and &quot;mind blowing&quot;
user interfaces and dashboards to engage a diverse and inclusive community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading4Char>Blockchain Consultants<br>
</span>Blockchain consulting companies and blockchain consultants are tasked
with advising companies on designing and implementing blockchain solutions.
This includes the documentation and maintenance of solutions, as well as their
initial implementations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading4Char>NFT Graphics Designer<br>
</span>NFT stands for a non fungible token, a special token that represents a
unique ID that is linked to a piece of crypto art that cannot be replicated and
is used to verify ownership of a piece. The collectable world is jumping in
head first and creating non fungible tokens that represent art, music,
memorializing events, newspaper articles and record releases. Designers are
needed to turn these moments/media into art for the thirsty NFT market.</p>

<h2 style='text-indent:-.25in'>e. Who Is Using Blockchain?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are a lot of really interesting use cases being
explored with blockchain right now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you first get into blockchain, one of the areas you'll
see people immediately jump to are healthcare, how can we manage our personal
health information on the blockchain, and voting an election reform, and both
of these are really, really interesting ideas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The goal behind the folks looking at blockchain for
healthcare is the idea that it would be great if your medical records could be
accessible with your permission to anyone else, anywhere on the planet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you're halfway across the world on vacation and you fall
ill and end up in a hospital, wouldn't it be great if the doctor treating you
had full insight into your medical records, knew any allergies you had, or knew
any prescriptions that you were already on?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's a very, very big area, and this ties a lot into
blockchain and Identity Management.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do we safely identify and protect people's personal data
on blockchain?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of interesting challenges there that are being worked
out...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain for voting and election reform is a big topic
right now, especially with all the conversation lately about how do we ensure
the integrity of elections and demonstrate that our results haven't been
tampered with or altered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is an area where blockchain could add a lot of value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then, of course, we hear a lot about traditional use
cases, areas that are getting a lot of traction in blockchain right now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Probably one of the biggest are supply chain, value chain
relationships, which are very, very common in today's economy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have very, very few products or services that are offered
completely and solely by one organization, without the involvement of other
vendors, partners, suppliers, manufacturers, third-party organizations, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain to track the supply, the origin of the goods and
services that we consume is a big use case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Walmart is really pioneering this right now with a
blockchain solution that they're using to identify the provenance of meat,
where does the meat that is sold in a Walmart store come from, and the ultimate
goal here is that, when we do have contaminated foods, and we have to issue a
recall, currently, because we just don't have good insight into that supply
chain, we recall and destroy a lot more food than we really need to, which is
tremendously wasteful, especially with all the people on the planet that we
could be giving that good food to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These are some real, real exciting areas that we see being
pursued in blockchain right now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the public sector, there's a lot of interest in blockchain
for law enforcement purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do we allow different law enforcement agencies at the
federal, state, county, city level, all to share data seamlessly, in a safe,
secure fashion, which also protects people's personal privacy and anonymity,
when appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another area where blockchain is getting explored and is
generating a lot of excitement is with artists, with people who produce
content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you're an author, if you're a musician, if you're an
artist, traditionally, you've only been able to get your work out to the
public, in the hands of the public, by going through a third-party
intermediary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I'm an author, traditionally, the only way I've been able
to share my creation with the general public has been going to a publishing
company and getting my works published.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain enables lots of interesting scenarios where I can
sell that work directly to consumers, create new subscription models, and this
is having very interesting effects on the work itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the things we're seeing is that traditional book
publishing, there's anywhere between 12 to 18 months delay between when the
author finishes the last word of a book and when it actually ends up into the
consumers hands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, if we can use blockchain to enable consumers to
purchase this material or subscribe directly to the content creator, we take
that lag time completely out of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this allows authors and content creators to do some
really interesting things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You could write a fictional story and have one of your characters
respond real-time to a news story that actually happened last week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It makes for very compelling reading and it's just something
we're not able to do today in the traditional publishing world because of that
delay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We also see a lot of interest in blockchain for fractional
asset ownership scenarios.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We know we're 10-15 years away from having self-driving cars
be a very regular thing, and when we all get our own self-driving car, if we're
smart, we're gonna have that car take us to work and then turn around and
perform ride-sharing services throughout the day, when we're not using it, in
order to recoup some of that investment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, in a blockchain world with coins and tokens, we can
fractionalize that asset ownership, and I can take that same money I used to
buy one self-driving car which operates in one city, and I could buy one
percent of a hundred self-driving cars in the hundred's biggest cities on the
planet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, if they're ever weather conditions, where maybe my
car couldn't operate locally, that's okay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have a much more diversified investment, which continues
to offer returns, because I have a virtual guarantee that any major city that I
have one percent of my car ownership in is currently in rush-hour right now, in
peak times of people needing a ride.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are lots of very interesting use cases for blockchain
in the real world right now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I would encourage all of you to dig in a little bit more,
and see some of the interesting things that are going on with blockchain in
healthcare, in public sector, in insurance, in supply chain, value chain and
more, see what other folks are doing, and then go out and make your own
blockchain dreams a reality.</p>

<h2>Blockchain Users: Business to Consumer (B2C)</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>A Business to Consumer (B2C) is business or transactions
conducted directly between a company and consumers who are the end-users of its
products or services. Services being provided to the consumer is an area of
interest to companies. Benefits to the consumer are transparency to the
consumer, accountability from suppliers, ethical sourcing validation, labor
verification and an immutable shared view.</p>

alt="Consumer Benefits from Blockchain"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Vertical markets see the advantage to the transparency
feature in blockchain. Financials, logistics, charity funding, agriculture and
ethical sourcing tracking are all markets leveraging blockchain to offer new
insights to the customer.</p>

<h2>Blockchain Users: Business to Business (B2B)</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>With a decentralized approach, blockchain&nbsp;removes the
middleman (such as banks and brokers) to facilitate faster and less expensive
payments. The shared ledger approach also eliminates the need for multiple
paper copies that need to be verified and updated frequently.</p>

<h2>Unintended Use Cases</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the coolest things about blockchain is some of the
unintended consequences a good blockchain solution might have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's look at an example.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Right now, there is a lot of attention being given to how
blockchain might be used, in general, for supply chain relationships and,
specifically, in the food supply chain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's pretend that you have a very young child and your
child has a serious pesticide allergy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course, when you go to the grocery store, you make sure
that you only buy the produce in the produce section that has the USDA organic
label.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's just a little sticker that goes on the produce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You buy your produce and you stand in the checkout line, and
you feel pretty good that the produce you're buying actually is organic and has
been treated with all-natural pesticides, and won't make your young child sick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But sometimes you wonder, standing in line, how do I really
know? How do I really know that someone didn't just print up a bunch of these
stickers in their basement and apply them at the last minute?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The blockchain can go a long way to solving that problem and
providing much greater insight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's say, you're standing in the grocery store one day, and
instead of the easily forged stickers, you're able to pull out your phone and
scan a QR code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you scan that QR code, instantly on your phone the
entire lifecycle of that piece of produce pops up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can see the date that it was planted on the orchard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can see after it was planted that an organic pesticide
company came along and treated it with an all-natural pesticide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can even verify that the pesticide is natural by seeing
the ingredient list in that pesticide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And finally, you may see who actually delivered that produce
to the store.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's say that there's a new green electric trucking company
out there - Ed's Electric Trucking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ed has seen all the fancy new Tesla semis. He thinks they're
great and he is committed to providing a transportation and logistics company
which is also environmentally friendly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, in today's world, you don't have a way of knowing about
someone like Ed and his electric trucking company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There just aren't good ways for folks in the B2B space to
communicate their business value directly to consumers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is an interesting potential byproduct of using
blockchain and smart contracts as a business solution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not only would I, as a consumer, have greater insight into
the origin of that produce and feel much better standing in the checkout line,
but maybe what Ed's doing resonates with me personally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe I'm a very green-conscious consumer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I didn't know there was such an organization as Ed's.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And I have to buy a few more things while I'm at the store,
besides produce. I have to buy some deodorant, some shaving cream, and some
laundry detergent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I buy that deodorant, shaving cream, laundry detergent,
I only buy the ones that were delivered by Ed's Electric Trucking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This gives Ed and other B2B players a new and exciting way
to establish brand and gain mindshare with the consumer that they currently
don't have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Certainly, it was not the original problem we went to solve
with blockchain, but many times, when we apply blockchain to a real-world
problem, we find out there are a lot of unexpected benefits just like this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Look for blockchain not just to transform the areas that
we're aware it might make a difference in, but also to provide some new
exciting and unintended benefits.</p>

<h2>Blockchain Users: Government to Consumer (G2C)/Government to Government
(G2G)</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>The public sector is the part
of the economy composed of both public sector and private sector enterprises
that are operating on behalf of the public. It is the business of taking care
of the people. Public sector includes all government, military, police, public
health and welfare, infrastructure, etc. Public sector organizations leverage
blockchain technology to move away from siloed and inefficient centralized
systems. Current systems are inherently insecure and costly, with duplicated
and in-efficient workflows. Blockchain networks offer more secure, agile, and
cost-effective structures.</span></p>

<h2>Dubai Use Case</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, when people first start getting into blockchain, one of
the areas they really start to look at is where is blockchain being used in the
real world, what examples do we have of a blockchain being deployed and at what
scale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And there's really no better example of this right now than
what's going on in Dubai.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, is
piloting a very ambitious program called smart Dubai 2021.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And what Smart Dubai 2021 aims to do is to move all
governmental operations and record-keeping on the blockchain by the year 2021.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The goals of this program are increased transparency in the
government operations, increased efficiency, and by proxy, providing better
service to city residents and constituents and establishing Dubai as a thought
leader, an industry leader in the blockchain space.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are lots of really cool applications that tie into
this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain is becoming the enabling layer for a lot of other
Smart Dubai initiatives around creating a smart city.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, projects like automated traffic signals, registration of
citizens for governmental services, etc. are all being pioneered on blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, if you want to see some of the really exciting use cases
in blockchain right now, be sure to check out Dubai and what's going on with
their Smart Dubai 2021 initiative.</p>

</span></span>Supply chain<br>
Blockchain is used in supply chains to gain transparency and traceability. This
has a special advantage for global health when used in traceability to the food
supply chain. By tracking food on a blockchain, you are building trust into the
system through the transparency feature. In the event of a problem, blockchain
technology can pinpoint the exact location and cause of a food health issue. By
instantly tracing food issues back to the source, all contaminated lots can be
tracked and dealt with instantly.</p>

</span></span>Global trade<br>
Blockchain is making headway in the global trade markets with transparency and
immutability that offer new relationships among distrusting parties. Blockchain
makes sure all relevant parties have access to the same information. Trade
barriers are reduced, from settlement issues, to compliance and regulation,
information is being shared and accessed in new secure ways. A distributed
ledger technology (DLT) opens up a new avenue for securely sharing data that
guarantees accuracy while removing banks as deal facilitators. Smart contract
and microfinancing alternatives allow all size companies to seamlessly trade
across borders.</p>

</span></span>Digital identity (self-sovereign identity and verifiable
credentials)<br>
Users of the Internet were all but unaware that all the information given so
freely when interacting with companies online, was being stored and sold. Data
became a siloed commodity owned by everyone but you. With new blockchain
technology, individuals can reclaim their identity information breaking the
need for data silos, endless passwords and hackable databases. Self-sovereign
identity (an individual identity holder controls their credentials and can use
them without permission) gives secure identity verification designed to bring
trust and personal control so people can prove things about themselves using
trustworthy verifiable digital credential.</p>

<h2>Chapter Overview</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this chapter, we will discuss distributed ledger
technology, some of its basic components and how it differs from previous
ledger storage techniques. We will gain an understanding of how previous
computer technologies like file sharing, data storage and cryptography are
wrapped into the blockchain foundations. We will also see how hashing functions
and Merkle tree data structures help us immutably store and prove facts without
revealing all the details.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, we will&nbsp;learn how these blockchain techniques are
fundamental in public-key cryptography where key pairs support privacy and
authenticity by only exposing the public key while keeping the private key
secure. We will examine how this agreed-upon, append-only distributed ledger
guarantees transparency and immutability, where trust in the information
contained in the ledger is a given.</p>

</span>Introduction to Blockchain Components</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this section, we're going to discuss the core components
of the blockchain, starting with a high-level view of the blockchain
components.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first blockchain component that we're going to look at
it's the ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, before we discuss the ledger, let's discuss briefly
the history of the ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The story of blockchain is tightly coupled with the story of
accounting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Historically, humans started off with no way to prove
ownership and we began with a single entry accounting system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The single entry accounting system for the first time in
human history allowed us to prove ownership of the asset.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ledger was associated with an owner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The single entry accounting worked for centuries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The issue with single entry accounting is that it mandated that
there was a single authority, which is the reason why there was the necessity
for a king or a queen to control the ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to have trade, right, at the international level,
we needed to have at least two authorities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For instance, for England to do trade with France, we had
the owner of the ledger, the single entry ledger, in England for instance,
doing trade with the king or queen of France, who also had their ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, we needed a new form of accounting, and that's where
double entry accounting came in, which was in use up until very recently, now,
within the last 40 years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What blockchain is? Blockchain is the very first
implementation of triple entry accounting, where we have an asset being
recorded on the ledger in the context of a transaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The third entry and triple entry accounting is cryptography,
where we have a cryptographic account of the transaction stored permanently and
immutably on the ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's what the ledger is. A ledger is a collection of
transactions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is not a collection of assets. Assets are part of a
transaction, but the ledger records the transaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In blockchain, the differentiator is that no one owns the
ledger, or all of the participants own the ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ledger is distributed. It is, in other words, it's
decentralized. So, there's a copy of the ledger that exists on every node that
exists on the network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Said simply, the ledger is a distributed immutable record of
a collection of transactions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bitcoin is the most popular asset.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was the first asset to be recorded as a transaction on a
blockchain ledger, and it remains the most popular, at least in terms of market
share.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's what the ledger is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we move to more modern blockchains, we start to look at
blockchains such as Ethereum, which not only records the asset on the
blockchain,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ethereum and other public blockchains like Ethereum, they
also allow you to have a permanent and immutable collection of code, also known
as a smart contract, that runs on the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ledger stores the assets, the transactions that are on
the blockchain, and it also holds the code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The code that's stored on the blockchain is a smart
contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Again, a smart contract is a program that runs on the
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The blockchain is a network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The blockchain is a ... A public blockchain is equivalent to
the Internet, complete with its own set of protocols, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Private blockchains are more synonymous with an intranet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is... just like we have a use case for public blockchains
and public internet, we also have use cases for private blockchains and an
intranet, if we're gonna stay with that analogy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On each of these networks there are nodes. The nodes are
going to be synonymous with the computers that make up the network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the nodes, they are put together by a collection of
protocols.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each blockchain has its own set of protocols that defines
not only the nodes, but how those nodes communicate with each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, when you hear the term &quot;peer network&quot;, that's
what we're talking about; we're talking about how that blockchain is put
together, what are the protocols that define the peers, and how those peers
interact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Those peer networks, they store the ledger, they provide the
updates, they effectively, they maintain the ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's what a peer is on a peer network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On a public blockchain, it's public, and, by definition,
that means that anyone is allowed to join and participate in that public
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the private blockchain, however, the situation is a
little different.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the private blockchain, we have to control who can access
your network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just like no company would allow... no company would allow
anyone to access their private intranet, in a private blockchain you have to be
asked to join, or you have to have permission to join.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A membership service is a gateway that allows users and
components to enter a private blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A membership service or a membership service provider
provides the services of user authentication, user authorization, component
authentication, component authorization, more specifically Identity Management.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we're talking about a private blockchain, then we have to
control who the members are, and not only the members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have to also control the nodes that access the
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we're talking about membership, one of the key components
of membership is we have to allow certain users to access the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to do that, we have to have a definitive identity
for each user.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the blockchain, that's achieved in two ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One, we use PKI, to provide a public key. And that public
key represents the identity of the user.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But we also need a private key that each user can hold to
prove their identity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That private key is stored in a wallet. And a wallet is a
collection of the user credentials. It is effectively ... it encapsulates
private keys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Additionally, in the blockchain... blockchains are
self-contained, or they should be self-contained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, one of the key aspects for developing on a
blockchain or using a blockchain is we have to have a way to interact with the
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And one of the ways that we do that is through events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, when something occurs on the blockchain, either public
blockchains... most public blockchains anyway, and certainly all private
blockchains, they have events that are fired when certain key actions are
triggered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This allows end-users, other systems, other users, different
components to be able to act off of the events that come from an update on a
blockchain.</p>

<h2>Basic Terms</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some terms that are mentioned in the video we will get
familiar with in later chapters, but are worth a brief description for
clarification:</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><i><u>Private Blockchains</u></i><br>
Private blockchains or permissioned blockchains have a Membership Services
piece that grants access to users before they can interact with the blockchain.</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><i><u>Digital Wallet<br>
</u></i>A digital wallet is a computer application that represents a
traditional wallet. It gives the user the ability to store and transact
cryptocurrencies through the Internet.</p>

</span></span><i><u>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</u></i><br>
Public Key Infrastructure is the identity management system for instilling
trust into the electronic transfers of information or value. It is the
technology used to authenticate users and information by issuing a set of key
pairs (public and private).</p>

buyer books a credit for cash spent in the same transaction, but in separate
sets of accounting records. This is where the blockchain comes in: rather than
these entries occurring separately in independent sets of books, they occur in
the form of a transfer between wallet addresses in the same distributed, public
ledger, which creates an interlocking system of enduring accounting records.
Since the entries are distributed and cryptographically sealed, falsifying them
in a credible way or destroying them to conceal activity is practically
impossible&quot;.</span></em></p>

Anthony (Tony) Riva.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The concept of distributed ledge's has been around for
hundreds of years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To understand the basics of blockchain, it's important to
understand how distributed ledgers work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A distributed ledger is a collection of data with no central
administrator that has been agreed upon by consensus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To understand more details, let's take a trip way back, back
into 500 AD on the island of Yap.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Yapese people used a very unique form of currency: the
Rai stone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each of these stones weighed around 200 kilos, making them
difficult to move.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To exchange them as money for goods or services, they
divided the stones into sections and then, they would announce to every adult
on the island who owned what part of each stone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each adult had to keep a mental ledger of ownership.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every time any Yapese conducted a trade, an announcement was
made to the entire tribe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each member of the tribe would then update their mental
ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today's description, this would be called a distributed
ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All Rai stone ownership was known to everyone, and that
knowledge was updated whenever a transaction was made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So why didn't just one member of the tribe keep track of the
Rai stones?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What if that main recordkeeper was sick, unable to do their
job, or was found to be dishonest?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the only copy of the ledger was changed by any means,
wealth would be lost or gained unfairly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Yapese knew their distributed ledger system safeguarded
it from tampering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since all the Yapese knew who owned what, it would be very
difficult to fool everyone on the island.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even if one tribe member moved away, the tribe still had
multiple copies of their mental ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this regard, the ledger was fault tolerant and could not
be easily changed, corrupted, or lost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The tribe also decided that stones didn't have to be on the
island to hold value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One day, a stone fell into the ocean and the Yapese decided
that this stone, even though it could not be seen, still held value and could
still be traded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This system of consensus by the majority of the adults on
the island with no central administrator is one of the first examples of
distributed ledger.</p>

<h2>The Evolution of Distributed Ledgers</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>We've gone through history and seen how ledgers have evolved
from stone tablets to double entry ledgers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We even took a look at the earliest known example of
distributed ledgers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, let's discuss the evolution of the ledger in the modern
world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Over the last few decades, ledgers have moved from the
written form to the digital form, also known as computers and digitalized
databases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This has allowed us to be interconnected - a truly global
economy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today, this recordkeeping system is being revolutionized
again, going from the digital realm or centralized databases keeping track of
transactions to information being stored across different locations across the
globe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This system of record, information across a global network,
is what we call decentralized ledgers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A decentralized ledger can be described as a ledger of any
transactions or contracts supported by a decentralized network from across
different locations and people, eliminating the need of a central authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a recording is made, every participant is notified of
that recording.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They now own an identical copy of the record of
transactions, identical to every other node on that network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every piece of information on a blockchain can be traced
back to the exact moment when it was created.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, if an audit is necessary, information can be found and
deemed reliable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This allows blockchain to serve as a truly reliable storage
of public records and transactions, and therefore eliminating the need for a
centralized authority of database of records.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now that we understand the foundational principle of
blockchains - distributed ledgers, it's important to understand another
important key element that makes blockchain so revolutionary: trust.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trust is created through two key principles: collaboration
and cryptography, both of which will be discussed shortly.</p>

<h2>Decentralized Ledger</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>As we can see by looking at
the evolution of the ledger, we are entering a new phase where no one
centralized authority has control of the details in the ledger, everyone does.
Transactions are only added to the ledger if everyone agrees. Once consensus is
reached, no one can go back and deny a transaction. So essentially you are not
trusting one person or entity to control the ledger, you're trusting everyone.
Let's look a little further into how that trust is achieved.</span></p>

margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>A
great way to think of blockchain is to think of blockchain as another layer of
the Internet, a layer that enables secure and trusted records and transactions
to occur, which is why a lot of people associate the word blockchain with the
word trust.</p>

margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>Now,
let's take a look into some of the key concepts of cryptography that are
utilized with blockchain.</p>

<h2>Rose Greenhow</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, one of the reoccurring themes in blockchain is that
while blockchain itself may be new and cutting-edge, it's built out of nothing
more than very old tried-and-true technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And one of the areas this is most true is in cryptography.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a lot of people first get introduced to cryptography
they think it's a very new cutting-edge science.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And while there are new developments being made everyday,
cryptography itself is a very, very old science.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One great example of this is the story of Rose Greenhow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rose Greenhow lived in the Washington DC area during the
Civil War, and she was actually an undercover spy for the Confederate Army.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rose Greenhow was a wealthy socialite, and she threw many
fancy, elaborate parties, and was also invited to many, many high-end social
events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many of these events were attended by members of the Union
Army, generals and strategists, who Rose pretended that she didn't know much
about military strategy and wasn't too interested in the war in general.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In secret, at all these events she was soaking up all the
information she could.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rose actually developed her own method of encrypting data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She came up with her own encryption scheme and she used this
scheme to mail letters down to the Confederate Army, revealing the plans of the
Union Army, troop positions, general high-level strategy, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rose did this for a number of years, until finally her
encryption method was broken and she was actually one of the very first people
who were arrested and prosecuted by the Pinkertons, who later went on to form
the Secret Service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, when you hear about blockchain and all the new
cutting-edge things that it's doing, don't forget that it has its roots in very
old technology, and we're just combining old technology in new and creative
ways to create a brand new solutions development platform.</p>

little over 2,000 years ago, Julius Caesar developed a simple system to send
secure information to his troops. It was all about substituting certain letters
for others, typically by shifting the letters by a predetermined number. That
algorithm is what we would call a cipher, and since Caesar’s invention, cipher
keys are much more secure and advanced. If you want to encrypt and decrypt
information, you are going to have to choose a kind of cipher to do so&quot;.</span></em></p>

<h2>Cryptography Key Terms</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's explain the key terms used in cryptography:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Cryptography<br>
Cryptography is a technique used to secure the communication between two
parties from a third. The term cryptography is derived from two ancient greek
terms, “kryptos” which means “hidden” and “graphein” which means “to write”.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Secret<br>
The data which we are trying to protect.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Key<br>
A piece of data used for encrypting and decrypting the secret.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Function<br>
The process or function used to encrypt the secret.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Cipher<br>
The encrypted secret data, the digital secret, the output of the mathematical
function or a cryptographic algorithm.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Encryption<br>
This is the process from plain text (ordinary text) to cipher text (random
sequence of bits).</p>

<h2>Cryptography Basics</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>So, one of the
technologies that plays a pivotal role in blockchain and making blockchain
secure and immutable is cryptography.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>If you've never heard
of cryptography before, cryptography is simply designed defined as the science
of sending messages back and forth from one party to another, in the presence
of adversaries or bad actors, participants who may wish to corrupt or change
the contents of a message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>And there's some key
concepts you should understand about cryptography before we really dive in and
talk about how cryptography protects the data on the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>Most cryptographic
functions are what we refer to as two-way functions, meaning that we can take a
secret and we can encrypt it, and then we can use that same process to decrypt
the secret at the other end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>Some of the key
objects or concepts to be aware of in cryptography:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>first of all are the
secret, what data are we trying to protect, what is the message we're sending
back and forth that we want to do so in a safe, secure fashion, and try and
guarantee that it hasn't been tampered with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>We take our secret and
we combine it with a key, a piece of data that is consumed by a function, our
third component.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>When the function
receives the key and the secret, the function uses the key to change the data
in the secret, to create the fourth and final component, which is known as the
cipher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>And the cipher is
simply the encrypted message, the thing that, if it were intercepted, if it
were seen by anybody else, any non-participants or bad actors, they wouldn't
know what the secret was, they wouldn't know what the message was, and they
wouldn't know how to decrypt that cipher back into the secret.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>Now again, most
cryptographic functions are two-way, meaning it doesn't do me a lot of good to
encrypt data if the receiving party at the other end can't decrypt it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>And oftentimes, all
this involves is using the same key or a reverse key into the same function,
with the cipher's input to get the secret back out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>So, when we talk about
cryptography, keep in mind those four basic components: the secret, the key,
the function, and the cipher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>Then, understand that
cryptographic hashing is a very special class of cryptographic functions,
which, unlike all their cousins, are only one way, meaning that in a
cryptographic hash I can put information or a secret into it, the key and the
function are contained as one entity, and what I get back out is encoded data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>I get what's called a
hash or a hash result, that is an encryption based on the data that I put in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>That is mathematically
impossible to reverse-engineer and this is what makes it a one-way function.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>If you put any data
into a cryptographic hash and you share that hash with me, there's absolutely
nothing I can do above and beyond random guessing to try and recreate that
input to tell me what your original secret was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>Cryptographic hashes
are used in scenarios where we want to prove a piece of data without sharing
that data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>So, password
management systems use this all the time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>We don't want to store
a username and password…we want to store a username and the hash output of a
password.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>That way, I don't know
what any of my users' passwords are, but I do know that if they put the wrong
password in, they're going to get the wrong hash back out, and I can easily
validate that a user's password is correct or incorrect, without having to know
what it is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>We're going to dive in
a lot deeper in a later module, to show you exactly through a demo how
cryptographic hashing works, and how it provides security and immutability on
the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>But just understand
these two big takeaways:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>Number one, that
cryptography is normally a two-way function with four components: the secret,
the key, the function, and the cipher, and then finally, there are a subclass
of cryptographic functions called cryptographic hash functions, which exist as
one-way functions, which can only encrypt the secret, and again, which are
mathematically impossible to decrypt the secret in any other method other than
randomly guessing input until you're able to recreate that hash output.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;background:transparent'>These are key
components which enable security and immutability on the blockchain.</p>

<h2>Byzantine Fault Tolerance</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you start to get more and more into blockchain, one term
that you're gonna hear a lot is Byzantine Fault Tolerance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if you're wondering what that means, that very strange,
cryptic sounding term, that can be explained with a story.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 1982, a mathematical problem was formulated called the
Byzantine Generals Problem, and without getting too detailed into the
mathematics behind it, essentially, with the Byzantine Generals Problem was a story
about two empires fighting a battle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One Empire exists within the confines of a walled city, the
second Empire has several generals surrounding that walled city, each with
their armies waiting to attack.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the balance of power is very, very evenly matched
between these two empires.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it is such that if all the generals agree to attack at
the same time, they will have enough power to overcome the empire in the city
and win the campaign.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If they, for whatever reason, they're not able to coordinate
their attacks simultaneously, and even one general misses the message, well
then, the Empire surrounding the walled city is going to lose the campaign and
the war.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, the Byzantine Generals Problem explored a really key
area of cryptography, in fact, the heart of what cryptography is, which is how
do I exchange messages with someone in an environment where they may become
corrupt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You have to understand the only way these generals had to
communicate was to send a disguised messenger through the city with a message
to deliver to the other generals, and so, this always posed the risk, if you're
a general and you're getting amessage from one of these messengers, how do you
know or how can you believe with greater than random certainty that the message
you're getting is reliable and it hasn't been tampered with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this, again, was a problem that was postulated back in
1982 and went unsolved until 2008, when the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto proposed
a solution to this problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Essentially, what the solution entails is all of the
generals hiring as many mathematicians as they can.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we talk about Byzantine Fault Tolerance, we're talking
about the generals having more access, having more mathematicians, or more
computing power on their side than the empire within the city.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, if I'm the generals and I can hire more mathematicians,
then that means that I can encrypt my messages going through the city with
greater and greater complexity, and if the balance of power becomes greatly
tipped in the favor of the generals outside the city,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they can use encryption methods which are so complex, that
there really is no real chance, or a very small chance that any of the
mathematicians inside the city will be able to intercept that message, decrypt
it, change the contents, re-encrypt it, and do so in a time quick enough that
the generals don't notice anything has happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, this is Byzantine Fault Tolerance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the fault tolerance mechanism that we see used in
most public blockchain solutions right now, including Bitcoin, including
Ethereum, although Ethereum is working on transitioning to a system called
Proof of Stake, which we'll talk about in a later section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But, when you hear Byzantine Fault Tolerance, often
abbreviated as BFT, all we're talking about is this idea that blockchains
become secure if they have more computing power, more hash power in the chain
than off the chain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Solutions like Ethereum, 16,000 plus nodes, or Bitcoin, the
largest blockchain network that there is, with over 30,000 nodes, offer us a high
degree of security and immutability, because the computing power on those
networks is so great that there's really no reasonable chance that an adversary
could ever control as much or more computing power to attack the data on that
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if someone ever were to, chances are the economics
behind it would be such that they would spend more to simultaneously harness
all that computing power, than they could possibly stand to gain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, this is Byzantine Fault Tolerance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is the root of cryptography, which is simply the study of
how do we send information back and forth securely in the presence of
adversaries and bad actors, and it's what underlies all the security and
immutability that we get in blockchain.</p>

<h2>Types of Cryptography in Blockchain</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>To understand cryptography in blockchain, you must be able
to differentiate between various cryptographic techniques used. There are four
main ways blockchain leverages cryptography:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Public Key Cryptography<br>
This encryption method uses a pair of keys: an encryption key, and a decryption
key, named public key and private key, respectively. The key pair generated by
this algorithm consists of a private key and a unique public key that is
generated using the same algorithm.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Zero-Knowledge Proofs<br>
A new approach to protecting digital secrets that prove knowledge of a secret
without revealing it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Hash Functions<br>
This type of encryption doesn’t make use of keys. It uses a cipher to generate
a hash value of a fixed length. The function converts plain text (no matter the
size) into a hash of fixed size. It is nearly impossible for the contents of
plain text to be recovered from the cipher text. Think of it like trying to
recreate a human from a fingerprint, a fingerprint uniquely represents a human
no matter the size of the human and you can’t reverse engineer a fingerprint to
recreate the human.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Merkle Trees<br>
A data storage technique that compresses or packs data for storing blockchains
with a tamper-free component built in. Merkle trees are built upon hashing
principles in that each hash becomes a part of the next hash to build a tamper
resistant data storage model.</p>

<h2>Public Key Cryptography</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Identity in the blockchain is based on public key
cryptography. A person’s address on the blockchain is their public key.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Transactions on the blockchain include their public key and
are digitally signed with the sender’s private key:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A digital signature verifies that someone in possession of the
private key authorized the transaction.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Digital signatures can be easily verified using the corresponding
public key, which is included in the transaction.</p>

Identity is managed by X.509 certificates. Certificates are only shared with
parties involved in the transaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Public key cryptography uses a pair of a public key and a
private key to perform different tasks. Public keys are widely distributed,
while private keys are kept secret.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Using a person's public key, it is possible to encrypt a
message so that only the person with the private key can decrypt and read it.
Using a private key, a digital signature can be created so that anyone with the
corresponding public key can verify that the message was created by the owner
of the private key and was not modified since.</p>

<h2>Private/Public Key Cryptography</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, I want to talk a little bit about cryptography and some
cryptography principles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first is easy and hard problems, and this is really what
public - private key cryptography is based off of.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are some problems that are very easy one way, but
difficult another way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And a great example of this is multiplication.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, if I give you a pen and paper and a lot of time, I can
ask you to multiply any two numbers, and you can probably come up with an
answer fairly easily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What's a lot more difficult is if I give you the product of
two numbers and ask you to factor that and find out all the numbers you can
multiply together to get that result, that's a much harder problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is how public - private key cryptography works.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We use an easy mathematical problem to generate a message,
but we make it very, very hard for that message to be decrypted by someone who
shouldn't decrypt it, and public and private keys play a big role in
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I want to show you right now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I've got two different wallets. I've got a wallet that
you're probably used to, that you keep money in, and then I've got a hardware
wallet, a digital wallet that you'd use to trade something like bitcoin or
ether.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, what you're used to, in your regular wallet, is putting
money in here and you keep your money in here, and if you lose this, whoever
finds it gets your money and they get to spend it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In blockchain, with cryptocurrencies, it's a little bit
different.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only thing that ever gets kept in here is your private
key.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And a private key - public key work together so that I can
use a private key to sign, digitally sign, any message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can then take the public key, which anyone can know, and
use that to verify that my specific private key was the one that actually
signed that message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, you can know without a doubt that I'm the one who
created that message,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that no one was pretending to be me sending this message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this is how it works trading digital currencies back and
forth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I decide I'm going to pay you three bitcoins and I'm
gonna do it out of this hardware wallet or any software wallet, any kind of
digital currency, the only thing that's kept on this device is my private key
and it never leaves, and so, that means if I want to send you some money, all
I'm doing is accessing the private key on this device to sign a message that
gets transmitted to the blockchain, that says I'm paying you some bitcoin or
some ether or some litecoin, and my public key is used to verify that that
message actually did come from the wallet that says it did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this is how we trade cryptocurrencies back and forth, and
that's what makes the concept of a digital wallet a little bit different.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I happen to lose this, I haven't lost the money that's in
it, because there's no money ever in it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All that money is is just a record on the blockchain, and,
as long as I can recover that private key somehow, I can just get a new device,
start using my private key again and keep right on trading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, that's how public and private keys fit into blockchain;
a very key component just to understand that they're used to sign and verify
any transactions that you make.</p>

<h2>Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Zero-knowledge proofs authenticate parties without the need
to widely transmit private information online. A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is
a cryptographic method that allows a party (the prover) to prove to another
party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any
additional information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's review an example. Let's say there are two toy cars,
identical in shape and size, except, one is red and one is blue. Jerry, who is
color-blind, holds the toy cars behind his back. Jerry then shows one of the
cars to Sam. Jerry then hides that car behind his back and shows Sam the other
car. Sam can consistently detect the switch because the cars are different
colors, but he never has to reveal the color of the cars to Jerry in order to
prove the secret.</p>

<h2>Zero-Knowledge Proof (Cave Example)</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this section, we're going to talk about a cybersecurity
idea in blockchain known as &quot;Zero-Knowledge Proofs&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Zero-Knowledge Proofs are exactly what the name implies -
they allow me to prove to another party that I have a certain piece of
knowledge without revealing what that knowledge is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Zero-Knowledge Proofs are often referred to as zk-SNARKs,
which stand for &quot;Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of
Knowledge&quot;, or zk-SNARKs for short,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>or, if you want to be simple, we can just call them
Zero-Knowledge Proofs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A great example of a Zero-Knowledge Proof is what we call
the cave door analogy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pretend that there's a circular cave, with only one entrance
or exit and at the back of this circular cave there's a door which can be
unlocked using a secret code entered onto a keypad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I want to prove to you that I know the unlock code
without revealing that unlock code to you, all I need to show is that I can
walk into one end of the cave, open the door, and come out the other end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I've successfully demonstrated that, then you know
without a doubt I've been able to unlock that door, but yet I haven't revealed
that unlock code to you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This simple cave door analogy is a Zero-Knowledge proof, and
if you can remember this cave door analogy,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>then you'll understand why Zero-Knowledge Proofs are so
important in blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, a user may make a request to send another user
some money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The blockchain naturally wants to make sure, before it
commits this transaction,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that the user sending the money has enough to send.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, the blockchain doesn't really need to know or care
who is spending the money, or how much total money they have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being able to answer a question of &quot;Does a user have
enough money to send to another user&quot; without knowing who the user is, or
exactly how much they have, is one of the primary use cases for Zero-Knowledge
Proofs in blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, when you hear about zk-SNARKs, don't get intimidated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's not a complex idea. Just think of Zero-Knowledge Proofs
and the cave door, think about how important it is in blockchain to be able to
prove a claim without actually revealing the information behind that claim, and
you'll understand Zero-Knowledge Proofs.</p>

<h2>Hash Functions in Blockchain</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When using blockchain, the need to trust a central authority
to verify the accuracy of data is removed and replaced by trust in a
cryptographic hashing function. With data integrity guaranteed by algorithms,
trust becomes part of the system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain provides users with data integrity in a trustless
environment. This is accomplished using cryptography in a way that moves the
burden of trust from data processors to cryptographic algorithms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hash functions are featured heavily in blockchain. A hash
function is a mathematical equation with four important properties:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hash
functions can take anything as input and create an output with a fixed size.
This makes it possible to condense anything into a piece of data of a fixed
size and is how messages are condensed for digital signatures.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It’s easy
to calculate a hash, but hard to determine a hash input from the output. The
best option is to keep trying inputs until one produces the desired output.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inputs
that differ by a single bit produce hashes that differ by half of their bits on
average. This prevents someone from finding a desired hash input using a “hill
climbing”.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is
infeasible to find two inputs that produce the same output when hashed. Since a
hash can take any input and produce a fixed output, it makes sense that
multiple different inputs will create the same output. A good hash function
will make it so that you have to try a large number of inputs before finding
two that produce the same output.</p>

<h2>Cryptographic Hashing Demo</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this section, we're going to talk about cryptographic
hashing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A cryptographic hash is a special kind of cryptographic
function known as a one-way function, whereas most cryptographic functions are
two-way, meaning that data cannot only be encrypted, but can be decrypted at
the other end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hashes, or cryptographic hashes, are very unique in that
once data is encoded, it can never be decoded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's look at a small example of this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we take a simple sentence, &quot;Let's eat,
grandma!&quot;, this input sentence will generate a unique 32-character hash
output.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This hash output can be thought of as an identifier for this
input data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In other words, I can input this data into a hash function
to generate this output, and I can share this output with anybody, anywhere,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>safe in the knowledge that it is mathematically impossible
for anyone to reverse-engineer the original input from this hash output.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In fact, the only possible way that anybody could ever
determine what this input was, was by randomly inputting data into a hash
function until they were able to recreate the same output.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another unique function of a cryptographic hash is that any
small change to a dataset, no matter how small, will result in an entirely
different hash.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I remove the comma from this sentence, not only do I
entirely change the meaning of the sentence,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also generate a new 32-character hash output.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This 32 character hash output remains a fixed length no
matter how big the input dataset is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To demonstrate this, let's take the entire first book of
Tolstoy's War and Peace, and paste it into our hash function.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You'll see that the most time-consuming part of this is not
generating the hash, but simply moving all the data from the clipboard into the
input text box.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I've generated a unique 32-character output or identifier
for this input text.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You'll notice that this is the same length hash that I got
when I had a short one sentence input, and if I change anything in this
extremely large dataset, even one character, I will generate an entirely new
hash output.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's take a look at this by removing the period at the end
of this sentence, and replacing it with a question mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You'll see that by doing so, I've generated a completely
different and unique 32-character hash output.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hash functions not only play a critical role in blockchain
security by enabling blocks to be linked together in creating immutability
between data on the blocks, they can also be used as a great way to identify
and verify large sources of data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's look at some other use cases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I want to build a system which authenticates users, but I
don't want to store their password directly in a database where it might be
stolen or corrupted, a hash function can be a great solution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's say I have a very simple password, password123, but I
don't want to store that password inside my authentication database.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I can simply ask the user to type in their password and
store the hash output from that password.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Any subsequent time a user tries to log on, I don't need to
know their password. I just need to verify that they're able to recreate this
hash output.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If they can't do that, because they have the wrong password,
then I can simply choose not to authenticate them into my system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cryptographic hashes can also be used to validate source
code or real large datasets in the real world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's look at self-driving cars for an example.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's say we've developed a self-driving car with the
intelligence to hash the source code every time it starts up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My self-driving car, every time I start the car, can take
its source code, run it through a hash and generate a unique identifier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It can then share this identifier or 32-character hash
output with every other self-driving car it has contact with, or even validate
this against a database or some other centralized data store, or perhaps an
immutable record on the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This gives me the confidence that if the source code for my
self-driving car ever gets hacked and makes it unsafe to drive,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'll know it right away. I'll try to start my self-driving
car, which will immediately hash its source code, share that hash output with
other self-driving cars or validate it against an authoritative source, and
instantly we can see I've got an entirely different hash output letting me know
before I've gone anywhere that my self-driving car is not safe, and putting
that self-driving car into a limp or shutdown mode, where it simply refuses to
go anywhere until the compromised software has been updated and replaced with
the right version.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cryptographic hashes give us a way to link all blocks on the
blockchain together in an immutable fashion, such that if any one particular
block or the data on any block is changed or altered to any degree, no matter
how small, we will know it instantly and we will break the link between that
block and every subsequent block.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you haven't watched the module in this course that covers
the in-depth walkthrough of Proof of Work consensus, you might want to check it
out now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We actually show how cryptographic hashing is used to link
together all blocks on the blockchain, creating a data store that is immutable,
secure, and extremely trustworthy.</p>

<h2>Merkle Tree</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>A special type of data storage structure based on hash
functions is called a Merkle tree:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>It is structured as a binary tree; the leaves contain the values
to be stored and each internal node is the hash of its two children.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>It provides efficient lookups and protection against forgery
since verifying a transaction is included in the tree. Can be accomplished by
sending only the transaction, the hash contained in each node between the
transaction leaf node and the root, and the hash values used to create each
hash sent.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Looking up a transaction in a Merkle tree with three levels includes
sending two transactions (the desired one and the other child of its parent)
and three hashes (the transaction’s parent, the root, and the root’s other
child).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

alt="Merkle Tree"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Merkle trees are a data structure that allows authenticated
storage with efficient data retrieval.</p>

<h2>Merkle Tree, Validation of Data</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchains use Merkle trees for fast and efficient
validation of data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Merkle trees summarize the entire set of data in a block by
creating a root hash of that data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A root hash is created by repeatedly hashing pairs of child
nodes until only one node is left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's take a look at a diagram of a Merkle tree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This diagram consists of four transactions represented as
transaction &quot;A&quot;, transaction &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and
&quot;D&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The transaction data is then hashed and the resulting hashes
are stored in leaf nodes represented as H of &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;,
&quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nodes are repeatedly hashed in pairs and the resulting
hashes are stored in child nodes until only one node remains: the Merkle root
or root hash.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reason you wouldn't want to hash the entire set of data
as a string is because it's not efficient when validating transactions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this example, if Alice needed to show Bob that this
transaction was valid, let's say transaction &quot;C&quot;, Alice would need to
send the entire list of data to validate the block.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But when using a Merkle tree, Alice only needs to send the
nodes that contain the transaction that she is looking to validate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's say Alice wants to validate transaction &quot;F&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alice would only need to send the data of transaction
&quot;F&quot; and four hash values to Bob.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob would then calculate the hash value based on the given
information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if the root matches the block, the transaction can be
assumed to be valid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Merkle trees allow for validation of a specific transaction
without requiring the entire set of data.</p>

<h2>Ethereum vs. Hyperledger Fabric</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The use of public keys for identity management is a logical
choice since knowledge of a public key is necessary for verification of digital
signatures. Both Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric use digital signatures on
transactions and blocks to verify the identity of the creator and that the
signed data has not been modified since signing. Public key cryptography is
used in the blockchain as a method for managing users’ identities without
revealing real world identities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Ethereum, users are identified by an address that is
directly related to the user's public key. This provides identity verification
while preserving anonymity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Hyperledger Fabric, users are identified via&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.ssl.com/faqs/what-is-an-x-509-certificate/" target="_blank"><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;color:#00688D'>X.509
certificates</span></a>. These certificates provide several pieces of
information about the user, but one of these is also the user's public key.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hash functions are at the core of all blockchain technology.
One of the primary uses for hash functions is chaining blocks together. In both
Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, blocks include the hash of the previous block
to tie the blockchain into a cohesive whole.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Zero-knowledge proofs are to increase the privacy of users.
Currently, Ethereum is working on a layer 2 solution, where a second layer
blockchain would store large amounts of data and only prove the batch of
information is valid to layer 1 (mainnet). Hyperledger Fabric has a pluggable cryptographic
library that supports ZKP techniques for enhanced privacy measures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Merkle trees are a data structure that allows authenticated
storage with efficient data retrieval. Both Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric are
smart contract platforms that use a particular type of Merkle tree called
the&nbsp;<em><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;

their virtual machine.</p>

</span>Disintermediation - Trust Through Transparency</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, that we have an understanding of how collaboration and
cryptography work together to create a layer of trust, let's discuss how
blockchain has a powerful disintermediation effect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nodes on the network are allowed to place data directly onto
the database that is shared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This eliminates the need for an intermediary to do such
task.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we discussed, developers can create a distributed ledger
on a blockchain,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and use cryptography to give people secure storage space on
that ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This creates a very different world than what we have come
to know today, because for the first time in the digital world, people are
allowed to own their own data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may be asking yourself: &quot;How is this different from
the current technology?&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today, organizations use our data, sell our data, store our
data, and exchange our data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Data is an extremely powerful asset and to own your own data
is a vast change to the current system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a world powered by blockchain, having ownership of your
database is truly empowering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can now share the information that you choose with any
organization that you desire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The power of blockchain and owning your own data is the
ability to transact peer-to-peer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With the current system of intermediaries, when you go out
to eat at a restaurant, and you pay with your credit or debit card, you're not
paying the restaurant directly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Instead, a database record at your bank is being debited and
the database record at their bank is being credited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this example, the value and data in the database belong
to the intermediary, and not the individual.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You are then dependent upon them to secure and validate your
transaction, which shifts the power to the intermediary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But in a blockchain world, the individual has their own
ledger record, and the secure key that allows them to access it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You no longer need an intermediary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A transaction is simply debited from your record and
credited directly to somebody else's record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain allows you to have the power to control more than
financial transactions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Later, we'll take a deeper dive into how the healthcare
industry may utilize blockchain to allow people to own their own health
records.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And with blockchain, you can determine who can access those
records.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We talked about how cryptography and collaboration create
trust.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, let's examine how peer-to-peer transactions with
blockchain create transparency which can lead to even another layer of trust.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This layer of trust can aid to curb corruption and even
create cost savings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Currently, the data and records owned at centralized
organizations are stored and hidden within a database.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These databases for the most part are inaccessible and do
not communicate in an effective manner with other systems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This also makes it easier for a corrupt individual or
persons within the centralized organization to manipulate these records.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because of the possibility for manipulation and foul play,
there are many flawed and expensive safeguards put into place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These safeguards are done through regulations and legal requirements
creating expensive overhead and delays.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Besides the mounting cost to safeguard these internally,
there are also many necessary safeguards from external forces, because they are
individual points of critical data storage, bad actors have to identify only
one point of failure to access.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The combination of one central point of storage and the
storage of valuable data make these centralized databases a very enticing
target for malicious persons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With blockchain, these malicious actors would have to identify
and target numerous points of failure until they control more than 51% or
what's known as consensus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In most blockchains, it could be up to hundreds of thousands
of points of weakness that would have to be exposed to be corrupted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's nearly an insurmountable task.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not only must a centralized organization worry about bad
actors, but they must do so, while still allowing access and synchronizing with
other centralized organizations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having to constantly update and synchronize data across many
centralized databases is not efficient.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The cost is high and the vulnerability to bad actors is
amplified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All the more reason blockchain solutions are so exciting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain offers efficiency. It also creates trust and
financial benefit through transparency, security, immutability, and
accessibility through ownership.</p>

<h2>Traditional Database Updates</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>A database is a collection of
interrelated data organized so that individual records or groups of records can
be retrieved to satisfy various criteria.</span></p>

alt="CRUD"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Traditional databases use the CRUD method which has four
main operations:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Create - add a new value to the database.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Read - read a value from the database.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Update - change an existing value in the database.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Delete - remove the value from the database.</p>

<h2>Transparency of Traditional Databases</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Traditional databases do not retain historical information:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Only the most recent versions of each value are visible.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Deleted values are not visible in the database.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>This limits the transparency of data contained in the database.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Values can be modified or deleted after creation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The CRUD update model of databases allows data to be changed
or removed from the database. This means that the visible data in a database is
not an accurate historical record of the database. The existence of an update
operation means that each value in the database is only the most recent version
of that value and could have had different values in the past. The delete
operation means that values can be removed from the database.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This limits the transparency of data in the database since
values can be modified or deleted after creation.</p>

<h2>Blockchain Updates</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The blockchain is designed to be a data structure that only
allows appending:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The past history of the blockchain is visible and immutable.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Updates to the blockchain can be performed by including them in
new blocks added to the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The blockchain is designed as a data structure where each
block in the chain locks in the value of the previous block and so on, back to
the first or&nbsp;<i>genesis</i>&nbsp;block. This means that the blockchain is
an append-only data structure without support for modification or deletion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The entire history of the blockchain is publicly visible and
stored in a distributed and decentralized fashion. Values in the blockchain can
be “updated” by appending a new version of that value in a later block, but the
complete history of the value is preserved.</p>

<h2>Transparency of a Blockchain</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>The blockchain is designed so
that its entire history is visible and unchangeable. Transactions in the
blockchain cannot be modified after creation, and their complete history is
publicly visible. This means that the blockchain is a completely transparent

easily verifiable by any user.</span></p>

<h2>Transparency: Databases vs. Blockchain</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Traditional databases and the blockchain were created for
different purposes and have different levels of transparency. Traditional
databases have low transparency since values can be modified or deleted;
however, this changeability allows them to store data in an efficient manner,
with only the most relevant versions of each value retained in storage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The blockchain is publicly visible and immutable, meaning
that it has very high transparency. Its append-only structure and decentralized
storage sacrifice storage efficiency for trustworthiness of the stored data.</p>

alt="Transparency: Databases vs. Blockchain"></p>

<h2>Transparency</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the big benefits we get in any blockchain solution,
public or private, is the idea of transparency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a public blockchain solution like Bitcoin or Ethereum,
because they're anonymous and we have no concept of identity, we have no way of
treating users differently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so all data on a public blockchain is transparent and
visible to all other participants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this is really important. It adds a lot of value, when
we're talking about exchanging currency or tokens of monetary value, because as
long as we can protect the anonymity of the participants, it gives us a great
way for anybody to validate the details of any transaction on a ledger that is
immutable, permanent, can't be changed and offers a high degree of trust.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This also has a lot of other really interesting potential
use cases that we're starting to explore with public blockchain technology, voting
and voter registration, tracking election results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These kinds of things are really, really great use cases for
having that level of public transparency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On public blockchains, there's another kind of transparency,
which adds a lot of value as well, and that is full transparency into the smart
contracts that execute on that blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These, oftentimes, are smart contracts which have the
potential of working with other people's money, sometimes large amounts of
other people's money, and if you're going to entrust your hard-earned money
into someone else's smart contract, it's really nice to have the ability to be
able to go and review the source code of that smart contract, either yourself
or by hiring a developer to audit that smart contract, to make sure it's
written fair, that there are no security vulnerabilities, and that it does what
it claims to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the private blockchain side, what we have [is]
permissioning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And we can control how open or closed our data is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We still have a lot of benefits of being able to share data
in shared infrastructure that private blockchain creates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are a lot of business networks and value chain
relationships where the participants would love to be able to share more data and
more information with consumers about the business processes and the steps that
go into delivering the goods and services we consume.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What has traditionally prevented solutions like this is the
lack of any kind of shared infrastructure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While technically conventional technology may be able to
address these concerns,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it is oftentimes human beings not being able to come to
consensus on questions of who owns the platform, who builds the platform, who
maintains the platform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And, if a participant leaves the ecosystem, do they take all
or part of the platform with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That have prevented us from using conventional technology in
these respects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Using private blockchain solutions like Hyperledger, can
help alleviate many of these concerns and create a truly shared technical
infrastructure between organizations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This allows participants in a supply chain or value chain to
track data and to share that data about how goods and services are produced, created,
consumed, and distributed into the open market, that we haven't really been
able to do practically before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's estimated that over 1/3 of the food we produce goes to
waste, because we don't have this kind of clarity into our supply chain with
food or into the supply chain with other types of products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Think about if a meat gets recalled because it might be
contaminated, how much perfectly good meat gets thrown away just to err on the
side of caution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Where if we just had greater resolution and visibility into
where that product originated from and how it went all the way from production
to our plate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then, we could issue more accurate recalls and reduce the
amount of food waste.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consumers might value your product more, your offering more,
if they're able to see where it comes from.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you're manufacturing and distributing clothing, and you
can demonstrate to consumers that all of that clothing was sourced from parts
of the world with fair labor practices consumers are going to have more trust
and faith in the brand and ultimately willing to pay a higher price for it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, these kind of transparency solutions are one of the
biggest benefits of blockchain and one of the areas being most explored, because
right now there are a lot of consumers who would simply like more visibility
into the products and services they purchase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And blockchain, both public and private, can be a great
solution for doing that.</p>

<h2>Immutability in the Blockchain</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain is designed to be an authoritative ledger of the
history of the network.</p>

alt="Immutability in the Blockchain"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This history may include financial transactions and business
agreements where modifications to the ledger may have wide-reaching business
impacts. Blockchain is based on an untrusted network, so trust that the
blockchain has not been modified needs to arise from the structure of the
blockchain itself, rather than from trust in the organization storing a certain
copy.</p>

<h2>Immutability</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, one of the big benefits of blockchain is what's known as
immutability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The idea that once a record gets committed to the blockchain
or to the ledger, it's there permanently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In blockchain, it's a little bit different than a database,
and we'll talk about this in another module, in a lot more depth, but in a
traditional database we're used to being able to edit records and delete
records, and that's not the case in a blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a blockchain, there are only two possible operations: we
can create a new record, and we can go back and we can read existing records.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this contributes to this idea of immutability - once
data is written to the blockchain it can't be edited, it can't be deleted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All you can do is add another record to the blockchain
indicating that something about that data has changed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This immutability is what makes blockchain such a secure
solution, and it's what makes it a trustless solution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meaning, I don't have to trust anybody that I'm interacting
with and trading with, as long as we both trust in the blockchain and the data
on the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then, we can transact back and forth seamlessly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The way immutability works is blockchain is, by design, a
very, very inefficient solution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are asking a large number of nodes, all the nodes on a
network, to perform exactly the same work as every other node.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Essentially, we are duplicating work over and over and over
again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reason we do this, is because the only way to
potentially change data on a blockchain, is by changing the record on that
blockchain for 51% or more of the nodes, or the miners, or the participants
trying to come to consensus on the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And when you get to very, very large-scale networks,
Ethereum with its 16,000 plus nodes, Bitcoin with over 30,000 nodes, this
becomes a very, very, very tall order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trying to hack or change a record on over 15,000 of those
Bitcoin nodes would be quite a bit of work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, it's not impossible to change the record on a
blockchain, but it is impossible from a practical standpoint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, one thing that should be noted when we talk about
immutability is: all that blockchain gives us is an accurate recording of what
was posted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is still up to whoever is posting that information on the
blockchain to make sure it's accurate and true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In other words, blockchain doesn't do anything to validate
that the information on it is correct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All it validates is that that information hasn't been
changed since it was originally written.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another way to think about that is, I could post a record on
blockchain that says: &quot;The sky is orange&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That doesn't make the sky orange.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We all know the sky is blue. All that does is that means I
can't ever come back later and claim I didn't say that or I said it was blue,
and someone changed the record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That immutability that blockchain gives us is that that data
was captured as it was originally written and hasn't been changed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another part of this immutability is cryptographic hashing,
and the way that we chain all these blocks together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you haven't watched the module on Proof of Work, I would
suggest you go watch that now, to see a really in-depth overview, a hands-on
demo of how blocks are actually linked together in such a way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And, if I ever went back and tried to change any information
or prior transaction on the blockchain, I would break that chaining in a very obvious
way that anyone would immediately spot if they came and querried that data off
the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you hear about immutability, just understand that all
we're talking about is the virtual impossibility of anyone ever being able to
come along and change any data on the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And also, along with that, understand that we only have two
possible operations on blockchain: we can only read data and we can only add
new data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There's no concept of an edit or delete, and this is what we
talk about when we talk about immutability on the blockchain.</p>

<h2>Immutability in the Blockchain Is Essential</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The blockchain needs to be immutable. If someone can change
the blockchain after the fact, then it is no longer a trusted historical
ledger. The blockchain is designed so that immutability is cumulative; each
piece is linked to every other piece, creating a cohesive whole that is more
difficult for an attacker to modify.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>At the bottom level, transactions are digitally signed by their
creators. An attacker can’t forge a transaction unless they steal a private
key.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A block structure is predefined. Attackers can’t modify it to
suit their purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The chain part of the blockchain is achieved using hash
functions. Each block includes the hash of the previous block, creating a clear
link between each block in the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Each block is digitally signed by its creator. The creator is
selected through the blockchain’s consensus protocol, making it difficult for
an attacker to be a legitimate creator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All four of these features help to make the blockchain
resistant against changes occurring after the fact.</p>

alt="Tampered vs Unbroken Blockchain"></p>

<h2>Why Is the Blockchain Immutable?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each transaction cannot be forged or modified because it is
mathematically infeasible to forge a digital signature. The structure of blocks
is publicly defined, and invalid blocks will be publicly rejected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each block “locks in” the value of previous blocks by
including their hash. Attackers cannot find another block that will produce the
same hash.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A block cannot be forged or modified, because it is
digitally signed by the creator. The creator of a block is either publicly
known (Proof of Stake) or difficult to become (Proof of Work), making
masquerading as the real creator difficult or impossible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, let’s take a moment to discuss how each of the features
mentioned contribute to the immutability of the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the bottom level, each transaction is digitally signed.
This means two things about transactions:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Existing transactions can’t be changed after the fact, because
the signature will no longer match.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Fake transactions can’t be created since an attacker can’t create
a valid digital signature for a transaction between other parties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both of these contribute to the immutability of the
blockchain since they limit the range of transactions that an attacker has to
work with if he wants to create a fake but valid blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, the block structure is publicly defined in the
protocol. This limits the types of modifications that an attacker can make to a
block when trying to modify the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Third, each block contains the hash of the previous block.
This is what ties the blocks of the chain together. Remember from earlier that
one of the properties of a hash function is that it is extremely difficult to
find two inputs to a hash function that create the same output. Since a block
contains the hash of the previous block, it’s difficult to find a different
version of the ledger’s history that matches the most recent block, as that
would require finding two different versions of the previous block that have
the same hash.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, each block is digitally signed by its creator.
Since the creator of a block is selected via a consensus algorithm, it’s
difficult for an attacker to become the legitimate creator of a given block. If
an attacker is not the legitimate creator of a block, it’s impossible for them
to create a digital signature that others would accept.</p>

<h2>Immutability Mechanisms</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, let’s look at how different blockchains implement
immutability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Ethereum and Hyperledger, the immutability mechanism is
the one that we’ve described previously. Each transaction and block is
digitally signed and are linked using cryptographic hashes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a href="https://www.corda.net/" target="_blank"><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;color:#00688D'>Corda</span></a>,
a multi-party application development platform, relies on its notary service
for immutability. Each Corda network has one or more notary services that
verify transactions. Each transaction is considered separately and, if
approved, is signed by the notary service. Transactions signed by a notary are
finalized and cannot be modified after the fact.</p>

<h2>Hashing and Chaining</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is important to understand the value of locking in the
previous block by including its hash in the next block. As explained in the
article&nbsp;<a

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Creating a ledger of transactions with blocks that refer to
previous blocks is a much better idea than numbering the blocks sequentially.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

page 25 and replace it with another page.</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The integrity of the book has been manipulated and altered.
However, there is nothing about the new page number that ties it (chains it) to
the content of the previous page.</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Instead, in a blockchain, blocks are referenced by their hash and
each block explicitly specifies which block (hash) it is building on.</p>

alt="Hashing and Chaining"></p>

<h2>Hashing and Chaining with Proof of Work</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>We will cover the Proof of
Work in a later module. However, this demo uses the Proof of Work to show how
blocks are chained together and how tampering with information in a past block
destroys the integrity of the proceeding blocks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this video, we're going to talk about Proof of Work
consensus, and how Proof of Work consensus is used to create an immutable chain
of block data on the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's take a small example. Let's say we have some block
data and, in the interest of simplicity, we will keep this very, very short.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But understand that in real life a block will most likely
contain many more than just three transactions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But on this block, we have a full block consisting of three
transactions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When it's time to validate a full block, all nodes on the
network will start to guess a nonce value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What we're looking for is a nonce value such that when we
take our input transaction data and we combine it with a nonce value, we get a
hash output that matches the difficulty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this case, the difficulty is a hash output that begins
with four leading zeros.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every node on the network will guess a different nonce
randomly until they happen to find one that matches the difficulty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, our node may start off by guessing &quot;123&quot;, and
we see that that does not produce a hash output that matches the difficulty of
four leading zeros.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's try again. Let's try &quot;973321&quot;. Once again,
that does not give us a hash output that matches the desired difficulty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[So], rather than guess over and over and over, let's go
ahead and ask a computer to do our work for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The computer is now guessing different nonce values randomly
until it happens to guess &quot;22294&quot;, which you see produces a hash that
begins with four leading zeros.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because this hash is the output of input to a hash function
consisting not only of the transaction data, but also of the nonce, changing
either one will result in a new hash output which does not match the
difficulty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I change &quot;22294&quot; to &quot;22295&quot;, you'll
see I get a hash output which no longer meets the difficulty criteria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, if I change any of my transaction data, I'm also
altering the input to the hash function, and thus generating an output which is
completely different from the desired outcome.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this way, nodes or miners on a network can validate they
have the same transaction data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we all start randomly guessing nonce values for this set
of data and my node guesses &quot;22294&quot; first, all it has to do is simply
share this nonce value with every other node on the network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each node can then try this value &quot;22294&quot; on their
copy of the transaction data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If any of the data has been altered or changed in any way,
no matter how insignificant, or the node in question simply did not record the
data correctly, this nonce value will not work for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, if we change &quot;4.2 bitcoin&quot; to
&quot;4.9 bitcoin&quot;, you'll see that the proposed nonce does not work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this way, all nodes can come to consensus or agreement on
what the right set of transaction data should be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a node thinks it's guessed the right nonce, it simply
shares that value with the rest of the network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the majority of the network, 51% or more, agree with this
nonce, because they have the same transaction data on their copy of the block, then
the miner who guessed this number first, will be rewarded and the network will
come to consensus or agree that this is the correct version of the block data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Any nodes which have different data for the current block
will then discard the copy of the current block they have and replace it with a
copy that the rest of the network has agreed upon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This method is used to create blocks of data chained
together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's say, that we have some transaction data here on the
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We're gonna go ahead and mine our first block.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, you'll notice what we've added in this demo is the hash
of the previous block, which is something we store in the header of every block
on the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because this is the first block, I simply get a previous
hash value of zero.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Combining zero with the current transaction data on the
block and the proposed nonce gives me a hash that meets the output difficulty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When it's time to validate the second block, the process
repeats itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I simply take the hash of the previous block stored in the
header of the current block, combine it with the transaction data in the
current block, and try to guess the correct nonce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this case, it's &quot;12314&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As discussed in our video on cryptographic hashing, changing
any of the input data, no matter how slight, will result in an entirely different
hash.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I try and change &quot;2.3&quot; to &quot;2.9&quot;, I no
longer get an output which matches the current difficulty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This new output is also reflected in the header of the next
subsequent block.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I have a series of blocks that have all been mined and
linked together, then you can see that going and changing data on any block
will break every subsequent block after it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, if I try to alter this record &quot;David pays Charlie
2.3 bitcoin&quot; and I want to change it to &quot;5.3 bitcoin&quot;, I change
the hash output of the current block.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is reflected in the current block and also in the next
block.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, the nonce proposed for the next block does not work
when combined with that block's transaction data and with the hash of the
previous block.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This means that if I want to alter data on the blockchain,
not only do I need to remind the block that I changed the data on, I also need
to remind every subsequent block in the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is no trivial task when you consider that major
blockchain such as Bitcoin and Ethereum contain millions of blocks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this process must be repeated on tens of thousands of
nodes worldwide in a very short amount of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This ability to link together blocks in an immutable fashion
and to cause attackers to have to undertake so much work, repeated so many
times is what gives blockchain its security and immutability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I hope you've learned a little bit more about Proof of Work
consensus and how blocks on the blockchain are linked together through watching
this video.</p>

</span>Chapter Overview</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this chapter, we will examine some blockchain functions.
First, we will discuss smart contracts, how blockchains have the ability to
store and run computer code (applications) that can execute the terms of an
agreement. These digital promises stored and executed on the blockchains remove
intermediaries and ambiguity thereby reducing conflict.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We will discuss how blockchains secure their information and
how these techniques differ from traditional database security. Next, we will
discuss different types of blockchains (public, private and hybrid models) and
design considerations that need to be made before blockchains can be developed.
We will examine the steps in a basic blockchain transaction from start to
finish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, we will discuss blockchain consensus models and why
they are the backbone to the blockchain operations. We will compare Proof of
Stake and Proof of Work models and be able to discuss the differences and
environmental considerations. Also, we will discuss private blockchain
structures and how permissioning mechanisms are the basis for their ConsenSys
models.</p>

</span>What Are Smart Contracts?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we make a transaction on the blockchain, understand
that there are only three types of transactions we can make.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's what I refer to as the onion model of blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And we're gonna start off with a very outer layer of that
onion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The thing that most people are familiar with when they get
into blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The thing we do all the time when we trade cryptocurrency
back and forth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is two or more parties coming together and using the
blockchain to record an announcement of the exchange of monetary value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, we might use blockchain to record the fact that I paid
you three Bitcoin for your used car or I paid you twelve blockchain for your
vacation home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the model that many of us start off with in
blockchain and again, it's the one that's most familiar and gets talked about
the most right now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But if we peel away that outer layer, and we take away the
idea of a monetary transaction or exchange, well, then we're left with two or
more parties using blockchain to record an important announcement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And we see many valid use cases around this. Let's say, that
I go to the doctor for my annual physical.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My doctor checks me out and he says: &quot;Hey Kris, I want
to put you on a new prescription for XYZ&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, maybe we're keeping our medical information on the
blockchain, and so my doctor and I both agree that's a pretty good thing to add
to my medical record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this case, we still need two or more parties, because
it's very important that I, as a patient, don't have the ability to go and
update my own medical record without a licensed medical professional involved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it's also equally important that my doctor is not able
to update my medical record without my consent or permission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, that's two or more parties coming together,
recording an important announcement or important data point, but nowhere in
that example has money or anything of monetary value exchanged hands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, if we peel away the very last layer, you can take away
this idea of having to have two or more parties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And what we're left with is just a single party announcing
an important or significant event.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this is the simplest type of blockchain transaction, and
also the most powerful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we think about blockchain, perhaps for managing a supply
chain scenario, we might have a grower of organic produce announce or commit a
record to the blockchain that says they've planted a crop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And we might have an organic pesticide company come and
treat that organic produce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We still have a single organization or single entity making
the announcement of something they did, and this is really the heart of
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you understand that it becomes really easy to
understand where smart contracts fit in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And smart contracts are just computer code. They're codified
logic that we can use to respond to any kind of event that gets captured on the
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In that organic produce example, if I want to notify someone
when that fresh produce has been treated with organic pesticide, so I can
create traceability for the end consumer,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>well, I might have a smart contract that manages that that
defines the rules and the steps that get taken when that particular type of
event occurs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this is all smart contracts are.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There's oftentimes a misconception when people hear the word
contract that they think of a legally binding agreement between two or more
parties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's not necessarily the case. Smart contracts don't have to
be legally binding and they don't have to involve multiple parties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In fact, if you come from a programming or development
background you can think of a smart contract easily enough as a
&quot;class&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you're not a programmer or don't come from a developing
background, you can just think of a smart contract as a set of rules that get
executed every time a certain type of event happens.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this is where the real power of blockchain comes in that
not only do we have a permanent, unchangeable record of all the different
events that have occurred,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we can also write computer code, very, very non-subjective
computer code, that defines exactly how that process is going to be managed and
what steps are going to be taken when that event occurs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This allows us to ensure process consistency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It allows us to ensure that processes that are normally
fulfilled by intermediaries or middlemen can now be satisfied on their own
without the need for human intervention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this leads to much more lean and efficient organizations
in way of organizing human effort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, when you hear smart contract just think about computer
code that you write to respond to certain types of significant events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you've ever worked with workflow or business process
automation or management tools, you can think of smart contract is just being
another workflow tool, albeit one that has the power to work with money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, don't get too intimidated when you hear smart contracts,
and don't get too caught up in the language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While they sometimes may be legally binding, they're not
necessarily legally binding in the same way a true contract is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They're just a way for us to bake our own logic into block
chain solutions to ensure that consistency of execution.</p>

<h2>Smart Contracts Recap</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s review some basic information about smart contracts:</p>

and do not need multiple participants.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Each step of a smart contract can only be implemented after the
execution of the immediate former step.</p>

<h2>What Do Smart Contracts Provide?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>These are some of the features that smart contracts provide:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Accuracy<br>
Replacing human intermediaries with executable code ensures the process will
always be performed the same.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Cost savings<br>
Replacing intermediaries often provides significant cost reduction.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Backup<br>
A blockchain and smart contract deployed to it can provide a permanent record,
allowing for auditing, insight, and traceability, even if the creator is no
longer in business.</p>

lawyers, brokers, or auditors.</p>

<h2>Campaign Finance</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>One area getting a lot of attention in blockchain right now,
is campaign finance and campaign donations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are some really interesting and compelling use cases,
ways that we might be able to use blockchain to do new and innovative things
around campaign finance that just aren't practical or feasible today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's say that I'm running for office and you want to
support my campaign.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, today, you might write me a thousand dollar check and
I get all 1,000 of those dollars right away to use for my campaign.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe, we want to use blockchain to empower voters to keep
their politicians more accountable to the promises they make on the campaign
trail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consider the following scenario.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's say, that instead of donating a thousand dollars to my
campaign, you write a smart contract on the blockchain to manage campaign
donations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You give that smart contract a thousand dollars instead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That smart contract has been programmed with the terms and
conditions under which it is able to release those funds to my campaign.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I might get two hundred and fifty dollars of that thousand
initially to use for my election.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I get elected, the remaining $750 can stay in the smart
contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Otherwise, it gets refunded to you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's say, I do get elected. Perhaps, I don't get the second
250 of that thousand dollars until a year in office, if I fulfilled three or
more of my campaign trail promises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then, we might say as a final step, I get the remaining
five hundred dollars to use for my reelection, only if I fulfilled 80% or more
of my campaign promises during my first four-year term in office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This would put a lot of power back in the hands of voters
and would keep politicians accountable for the promises they make, long after
election day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While things like this certainly are possible with
conventional technology, they're not very practical or feasible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain and smart contracts puts this power back in the
hand of voters and has the potential to radically reform campaign finance and
campaign donations.</p>

</span>Blockchain Security vs. Standard Cybersecurity</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain is commonly called the future of computing. It
takes a very different approach to data storage and processing and requires a
very different perspective for security.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this section, we will discuss some of the ways that
security differs in traditional and blockchain environments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=384 height=278 id="image054 - Blockchain security vs standard security"
src="https://github.com/bbauska/LFS170x-2021/blob/main/images/image054.png?raw=true"
alt="Blockchain Security vs. Standard Cybersecurity"></p>

<h2>Introduction to Blockchain Security vs. Standard Cybersecurity</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this section, we're gonna talk a bit about how
traditional cybersecurity is different than security concerns on the
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In traditional cybersecurity that we're all used to, we're
very perimeter-focused meaning that we put trusted data and assets behind a
very, very strict perimeter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We assume that anybody we let inside that perimeter is
trusted, either partially or fully, to see that data and access those
resources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the brunt of our focus goes into making sure that we
keep the right people from getting beyond that perimeter,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that we only let authorized users through, and then we
prevent any attackers or strangers from breaching that perimeter and accessing
the data and resources we store behind it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is very different from blockchain, which runs on a
massively decentralized peer-to-peer global network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just by its very definition, you can see that there is no
perimeter on blockchain, and so our security has to come from somewhere else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our security on blockchain comes from the incredible amount
of repetition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fact that we ask every node to keep the same copy of the
ledger and periodically to reach consensus, majority consensus, on what the
proper data in that ledger should be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This makes the amount of work that an attacker would have to
do practically impossible, if they wanted to change, hack, or alter the ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another big difference between traditional cybersecurity and
security on the blockchain is with conventional applications and conventional
technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We either develop all our own code or application parameters
in-house or we rely on a single, third-party trusted provider who creates that
line of business system for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All the code, generally, comes from one place, and if we
don't write it ourselves, all we have to have is trust and faith in the
third-party organization providing it to us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In blockchain, things are a little bit different, because
oftentimes in blockchain solutions we're writing smart contracts which call
code from other smart contracts, which we may or may not write ourselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And which may come from a variety of different authors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, whereas in the traditional cybersecurity space, we
really only need to rely on our own due diligence to write secure code or the
due diligence of a third-party application provider.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In blockchain, we have to expend a lot more time and energy,
making sure that the code and the contracts we're calling is safe and secure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In other words, we want to make sure that we're not
inheriting any security vulnerabilities from other smart contracts that have
been written by unknown and potentially untrusted parties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the final big difference between conventional
cybersecurity and blockchain is that in conventional line of business systems
all of our applications either run directly on trusted hardware that we own as
an organization or run on hardware with a high degree of trust provided by a
third-party such as Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the blockchain world, all of our code runs on untrusted
resources, untrusted hardware that can be owned by anyone, anywhere in the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This means that we must ensure that all the trust in a
blockchain solution comes from the protocol and the code layer itself, because
it's a much more massively distributed network, and we don't have direct
control or access into the hardware that supports it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, there are a lot of differences between conventional
cybersecurity and security in the blockchain space that you're going to want to
understand before you deploy your own blockchain solutions.</p>

<h2>Blockchain Security Environment</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the primary differences between cybersecurity in a
traditional computing environment and on the blockchain is the environment
itself and what it is and isn't designed to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Standard Cyber Security</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The traditional computing environment is a company network fully
or, at least mostly, under the control of the company's computer security
staff.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>While many organizations are making the shift to cloud-based
environments, they still have a high degree of control over the security and
configuration of their rented systems.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Traditional networks are highly centralized, and the focus of
cybersecurity on these systems is primarily perimeter-focused. All systems and
authorized users on the network are trusted or semi-trusted, so the focus is on
preventing attackers from entering from outside the network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Blockchain Cyber Security</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Blockchains are designed to be decentralized, distributed systems
running on untrusted hardware.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>While security in traditional environments is designed to provide
security by putting all data in one place and building walls around it,
security in blockchain is based on ensuring that data is protected from
modification by copying data to as many locations as possible to make
modification of all copies infeasible.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Traditional infrastructure focuses on confidentiality and
integrity, while blockchain is designed to provide integrity and availability.</p>

<h2>Security Attacks</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both traditional computing environments and blockchain have
security considerations associated with them. In many cases, the same attack is
possible against both paradigms, but the details of how to implement it vary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, we will discuss how a few different attacks can be
launched against traditional computing environments and blockchain.</p>

<h2>Security Attacks: Denial-of-Service (DoS)</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is when an attacker makes
it impossible for a system to serve its users as designed. This can be
accomplished by exploiting a flaw in the system, but, more commonly, is
accomplished by performing legitimate actions at a rate higher than the target
can handle. To be effective, denial-of-service attacks typically focus on a
system’s weakest link or bottleneck.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In traditional environments, denial-of-service attacks target a
company's web server to prevent customers from accessing the company's
services. This can be accomplished by making more connection requests than the
server is capable of supporting.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In blockchain, a denial-of-service attack involves submitting
more transactions to the blockchain than it can handle. Since many blockchains
have fixed-size blocks created at a fixed rate and are stored in a distributed
fashion, they have a maximum capacity that a determined attacker can exceed,
rendering the blockchain unusable.</p>

<h2>Security Attacks: Endpoint Security</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Traditional infrastructure and blockchain environments also
differ with regard to endpoint security. Endpoint security originated to ensure
multi-layer prevention against malware, fraud, cyber threats, and attempts to
extract private information.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In traditional cyber, endpoints are under the control of the
enterprise and have some level of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity can be dangerous
because an attacker has more options for finding a vulnerability to exploit.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In blockchain, endpoints are the nodes and may be completely
homogeneous. While homogeneity means that a flaw in one system is a flaw in all
of the systems, blockchains built in trust and data privacy feature guard
against such attacks.</p>

<h2>Security Attacks: Code Vulnerabilities</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Computer applications are dependent on reliable code.
Another way that traditional and blockchain cybersecurity differ is in the
level of trust in the code used in a company's applications.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In traditional cyber, the company writes most of the code, and
vulnerabilities can arise only from code that the company controls.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In blockchain, anyone can write a smart contract, and a flaw in
the smart contract or the underlying platform code can have wide-reaching
consequences. But since smart contracts can be vetted and reused, such
inconsistency can be edited from the code. We will discuss an example of a
vulnerability in a platform's code in a later section covering the Ethereum
network.</p>

<h2>Security Attacks: Intentional Misuse</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both traditional and blockchain environments are vulnerable
to attacks based on intentional misuse of the system.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In traditional cyber, insider attacks or intentional misuse of
the system by clients are possible. In fact, a denial-of-service attack is a
specific type of intentional misuse.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Blockchain systems are set up to incentivize network
participants, miners or nodes, to do something that is in their best interest.
A weakness is, if more than half of the network's processing power is
controlled by a single group, the network is controlled by that group.</p>

<h2>Security Attacks: Data Protection</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, traditional infrastructure and blockchain differ in
their goals regarding data protection.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In traditional cyber, data is siloed, and access is strictly
controlled by the owners, placing responsibility for confidentiality,
integrity, and availability in their hands.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In blockchain, data is distributed, and the blockchain is relied
upon to provide integrity and availability.</p>

<h2>Different Types of Blockchains</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we try to understand the main difference between a
public and private blockchain, it is important to understand the terminology.</p>

</span></span>Public Blockchains<br>
A public blockchain is open to anyone to join. Public blockchains are
decentralized where no one has control over the network. These immutable and
censorship resistant networks are ideal for participants who don't trust each
other, but still interact in a network and take part in consensus. Bitcoin and
Ethereum are examples of public, permissionless blockchains.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Permissionless Blockchains<br>
Public blockchains are permissionless. Anyone effectively can join the
blockchain network. No one is prohibited from joining.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Private Blockchains<br>
Private blockchains define a user's rights on the network prior to admittance.
Restrictions are placed on activities such as who can write to the ledger and
what transaction they can participate in. Hyperledger and Corda blockchains are
examples of private permissioned blockchains.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Permissioned Blockchains<br>
In a permissioned blockchain, participation is permissioned by an organization
or a consortium of organizations. This empowered entity defines who can
participate in certain transactions and consensus on the network.</p>

<h2>Public (Permissionless) Blockchains</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When people get into blockchain, there's a natural
discussion about what type of blockchain, because blockchain comes in many
different types and flavors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And normally, we hear about public versus private
blockchains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One factor that often gets left out is also the idea of an
open versus closed blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it's important to consider both parameters, so you know
where on a possible solutions quadrant your idea falls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we talk about public and private, what we're really
talking about is who is able to write data onto that blockchain or onto that
immutable ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The open versus closed brings in to consideration who's able
to read that data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, we can talk about solutions which are public and
open, public and closed, private and open, private and  closed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we talk about public blockchains, what most folks are
really talking about is a public open blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's a blockchain where anybody can come write data to the
blockchain, anybody else can come read that data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, public blockchain platforms like Bitcoin, Ethereum,
Litecoin tend to get talked about a lot right now,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and these are what we also refer to as permissionless
blockchain platforms meaning that they really strive to, by design, increase
and protect the user's anonymity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And, if we don't know who a user is, if we don't have a way
of identifying individuals, and we don't have any way of creating permission or
access rules around that user,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and it's what we get, is the system where anybody can commit
data to that blockchain and anybody can come along and read data to that
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There's a perception that public blockchain platforms like
Ethereum can't be used to build permission scenarios or to control access to
data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The truth is they can, they just don't give you the built-in
tools that a private or permission blockchain platform will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can always use these open public platforms to build a
permission solution, but just understand that it's upon you, your architects,
and your developers to create that permissioning model, and that all starts
with some kind of identity management system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you think of public blockchains, you think about
blockchain platforms like Ethereum, understand, by default, by the very nature
and design, they're designed to protect anonymity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And, if we don't know who a user is, then we really have no
way of creating permissions, role-based access and controlling what data they
can read or write.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a lot of situations, this is desirable, this is why we
see cryptocurrencies based on public blockchain platforms, because having that
anonymity is important.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And, if a user has a currency, something of value, they
should be able to exchange it and spend it, and do what they want with it, just
like anybody else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We don't want to treat any class of users differently than
any others in those scenarios.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's a public blockchain, and that's a very different
animal from the private permission blockchain.</p>

<h2>Public Blockchain Benefits</h2>

by Demiro Massessi, public and private blockchains have different features. The
benefits of public blockchain are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Immutable<br>
When something is written to the blockchain, it cannot be changed.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Open Consensus Model<br>
No restriction placed on who can operate a node in the network.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span

</span></span>Open read and write<br>
Anyone can participate by submitting transactions to the blockchain, such as
Ethereum or Bitcoin; transactions can be viewed on the blockchain explorer.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Low barrier to entry<br>
Transactions on a public network can be accomplished with an Internet
connection and a cell phone.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Secure due to mining (51% rule)<br>
With Bitcoin, obtaining a majority of network power could potentially enable
massive double spending, and the ability to prevent transaction confirmations,
among other potentially nefarious acts. This has never been accomplished as the
computing power needed to stage such an attack would be too costly.</p>

<h2>Private (Permissioned) Blockchains</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The counterpart to a public blockchain is naturally a
private blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These are platforms like Hyperledger or Hashgraph.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And private blockchains are more specifically known as
permissioned blockchains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we talk about private blockchain or when you hear folks
talking about private blockchain solutions, they tend to be talking about
things on the private and closed end of the spectrum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We want to control who can write data to this blockchain,
and we want to control who can read data from this blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And in order to do that, the first step is identity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we don't know who a user is, it becomes difficult, if not
impossible, to define rules about what data they can commit to the ledger and
what data they can consume from the ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we talk about private blockchain, just think about
permission blockchain, the blockchain which right from the beginning is an idea
of who you are.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this is very different from a public platform like
Ethereum, in which the platform tries to protect and maximize anonymity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And we, by design, don't know who a user is, unless we build
in that kind of identity management scheme.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Private blockchains tend to come with identity management
tools or a modular architecture, where you can plug in your own identity
management solution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This can be anything from an Active Directory deployment to
an OAuth solution using Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just understand the idea behind the private blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All begins with understanding who a user is, because once we
understand who a user is, we can determine what role they're in, and we can use
that role to determine what information should they and should they not have
access to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This also changes the incentive for good behavior a little
bit in a public blockchain, because we don't know who a user is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We rely on economics and game theory incentives to ensure
that everybody in the system behaves honestly and according to the rules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We set up situations through group consensus, which we
discuss in other sections in this course, through which honest participants are
economically rewarded,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>where dishonest ones only incur work or cost, with no possibility
of ever recouping that cost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a private permission blockchain, we rely on the fact that
we know who a user is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a corporate scenario, blockchain for the business,
blockchain for supply value chains, because we know who an individual is, what
organization they're associated with and what their role is, we also assume
that they're going to behave fairly aboveboard, because if not, we know exactly
who's misbehaving and they know that they're gonna suffer the consequences for
that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Public and private blockchains, two very, very different
offerings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of people make the impression, get the impression that
they compete with one another, when really they don't.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They just serve to provide different types of solutions and
enable different kinds of products and offerings to be built on top of them.</p>

<h2>Private Blockchain Benefits</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following benefits of a private blockchain have been
described in the&nbsp;<a

<h2>Security: Public vs. Private Blockchains</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>As discussed in&nbsp;<a

target="_blank"><i><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;
color:#00688D'>&quot;The Difference Between Public and Private Blockchain&quot;</span></i></a>&nbsp;article
by Praveen Jayachandran, both public and private blockchains share many
similarities:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Both are decentralized peer-to-peer networks, each maintaining a
shared append-only ledger of digitally-signed transactions.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Both maintain transaction replicas in-sync through a protocol
referred to as consensus.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Both provide certain guarantees on the immutability of the
ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the other hand, as described in&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/public-private-permissioned-blockchains-compared/#:~:text=The%20primary%20distinction%20between%20the,and%20maintain%20the%20shared%20ledger"
target="_blank"><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;
color:#00688D'>Investopedia</span></a>, the main difference between a public
and private blockchain is related to who is allowed to participate in the
network, execute the consensus protocol, and maintain the shared ledger:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A public blockchain network is completely open and anyone can
join and participate in the network.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A private blockchain network requires an invitation, and must be
validated by either the network starter or by a set of rules. Private
blockchains are usually set up as permissioned networks, placing restrictions
on who is allowed to participate in the network, and only in certain
transactions.</p>

<h2>Public and Private Comparison</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now that we've talked about public and private blockchains,
what those terms mean and again, you can think of that as permission versus
permissionless blockchains, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can talk about some of the differences and what each
different type of platform aims to provide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Public blockchains are really good for scenarios where
protecting the anonymity of users is important or adds value to the solution
and they're really great platforms for solutions where all users should be
treated equally and we can see this because most public blockchains right now
are used to support crypto currencies and this is a real great use case with a
crypto currency like Bitcoin, Litecoin, ether etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We don't want to have any permissioning or role based access.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anybody should be able to own some Bitcoin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anybody should be able to trade it with anybody else and
it's not necessarily important that we know who the participants in any
transaction are.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That leads to an open permissionless model with full
transparency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is very different in the corporate world where we see
private blockchains being adopted at scale because the concerns are the
opposite in a corporate scenario.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a business scenario, anonymity is a bad thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I want to know exactly who all the participants are and I
need to know who they are because I don't want full transparency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I don't want to share all my business data with all the
participants in my business network or the general public at large.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I want to control who sees what type of information, under
what circumstances and I also want to control who is able to contribute that
information onto the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I might use a private blockchain solution to manage supplier
vendor relationships where only myself and my suppliers can see the price that
I'm paying for a certain item. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only a particular supplier gets to see the details of the
contract that I have and not the details of a contract I have with any other
suppliers and I may wish to share some of this high-level macro data with
consumers so that they can see the origins of the products they're buying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But, of course, I'd want to hide the financials behind all
that so when we look at how these two solution types differ, we see the public
blockchains tend to focus more on b2c or business to consumer scenarios.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whereas private blockchain offerings like hash graph, hyper
ledger really lends themselves well to be to be scenarios supply chain value chain
relationships or creating any kind of shared infrastructure between enterprises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just to understand that well there's a big misconception
that these are competing offerings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They're really not and many real-world use cases use
components of both.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's important to understand the difference between them and
it really all starts with Identity Management.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you're thinking in your head about public versus
private blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To understand that it all begins with Identity Management
and in a private blockchain I know who all the participants are right from the beginning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the public blockchain, again, I don't know who those
participants are and that's not to say that I can't build a permission solution
on a public platform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But, myself, my architects, and my developers are gonna have
to develop the logic and the mechanisms behind identity management so that's
public and private blockchain, two very different animals, they serve vastly
different purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you start to dig into a lot of real-world use cases, what
you're going to find is many use cases make use of both types of blockchain,
integrated seamlessly to you.</p>

<h2>Is Blockchain Right for You?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consider the following aspects before deciding if blockchain
is for you:</p>

important to determine which platform and structure is right for your business.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Central authority<br>
Some organizations rely on one person having control, with blockchain
decentralized work flows without a single point of failure are emerging.</p>

<h2>Blockchain Is Like Hot Sauce</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>One important thing to keep in mind as you're evaluating
blockchain, is it's like hot sauce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And I want to give credit where credit is due for this
analogy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This was inspired by a friend of mine, Samson Williams, a
thought leader in the blockchain space.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Samson loves to talk about blockchain being a lot like
hot sauce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hot sauce is surprising because you can put it on a number
of things and it really tastes good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But there are some things hot sauce just doesn't belong on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You'd never put hot sauce on an ice cream.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Understand that blockchain is like hot sauce - there are a
lot of areas you can add a little splash of blockchain to, and end up making a
much better and more compelling solution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But there are some areas that you can't add blockchain to
without making things a lot worse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And just like hot sauce, there is a big misconception that
blockchain is an all-or-nothing proposition, that if we're going to architect
and develop a solution on blockchain, we either have to build something that
exists entirely on blockchain, or we need to build something that exists
entirely on conventional technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The truth is that like hot sauce, blockchain is really best
when it's combined with something.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you were hungry and poured yourself a big bowl of hot
sauce, not only would you be unsatisfied and unhappy, but you wouldn't want to
repeat the process again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's the same way with blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are looking at building a solution completely and
entirely on the blockchain, without exploring some of the amazing potential
that you get by combining blockchain with conventional technology, then you
probably got a bad recipe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, when you're thinking about blockchain, and how to add it
to your personal and professional life, understand that it's not a meal all by
itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's just a little splash of hot sauce you put on something
that already works pretty well.</p>

<h2>Blockchain Considerations</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Companies must consider many factors when deciding how
blockchain will fit into the business model. There is not a “one size fits all”
blockchain but rather a well-thought-out approach that considers many options.</p>

</span></span>Governance<br>
Governance of blockchains deals with a system for managing and implementing
changes to blockchains. Chapter 4, “Blockchains and Governance”, covers how blockchain
is managed and how changes are implemented.</p>

</span></span>Smart contract functionality<br>
Each organization has unique needs when deciding on smart contract
functionality. Such decisions as to the design, implementation and testing of
these digital promises need to be determined. Can smart contracts replace or
accentuate current work flows? Can a previously written smart contact fit in
the current business model?</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Consensus algorithms<br>
Consensus models change depending on the type of blockchain environment you are
creating. In order for a blockchain to work, the participants must come to an
agreement as to the transactions in the ledger or the state of the ledger. This
agreement is called consensus. Public blockchains have miners that are
incentivized to reach consensus whereas private blockchain set up enterprise
nodes that agree to the state of the ledger. We will discuss consensus models
later in this chapter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Integration<br>
Consideration for current work flows and how to bridge blockchain platforms
with existing systems are a vital conversation. How can blockchain add value to
your current organization while leveraging your existing systems?</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Cryptocurrency requirements<br>
As mentioned previously, a cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange digitally
enabled by blockchain. Cryptocurrencies secure and keep track of assets on a
public blockchain. Enterprise blockchains generally do not use the
cryptocurrency feature. Decisions on if and how your blockchain will exchange
value among participants are important discussions that need to occur during
the design phase.</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Cost modeling<br>
New questions arise around consortium type blockchains, one consideration is
how to split the technology cost among the participants in a fair and equitable
manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Overall, blockchain decisions will be made by actors in the
blockchain system:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>System Architects design and build blockchain networks. This
includes decisions on node types and membership rights.</p>

use.</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>System Operators interact with the software, permissioning and
onboarding participants. This includes storing the ledger, creating wallets and
managing credentials.</p>

<h2>Blockchain Transaction Flow</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this section, we'll discuss the blockchain transaction
flow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Regardless of the blockchain technology, the flow of data
through a blockchain will remain relatively the same, at least at a high level.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It will all start with a blockchain user performing an
operation that should be stored on the chain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The operation will trigger a smart contract, or it will
trigger chaincode.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In either case, the code will be executed on the actual
blockchain itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The output of this code will result in a transaction, and
that transaction is what we intend to be stored on the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, the blockchain operators using protocols that will be
specific to the specific blockchain that's running on will spread that
transaction throughout the blockchain network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The block creators will collect all of the transactions and
it will create a new block.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In most blockchains, this is the job of the miner and is the
output of the mining process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The block operators will spread the block through the peer
network to update the ledger copies once consensus has been achieved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this results in the block operators again executing code
included in transactions within the block to update their own copy of the
internal state of the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The users will be notified of an event from a blockchain
creation via an event.</p>

<h2>Blockchain Transactions</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although blockchains can differ in form and function, all
follow a basic transaction flow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"inherit",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

alt="Blockchain Transactions"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"inherit",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Step 1: Operation Initiated</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's follow the step with a basic Bitcoin transaction. If
Alicia wants to send Billy some bitcoin, she would go to a Bitcoin wallet
application either on her phone or computer where she has some Bitcoin stored.
Wallet applications are usually free downloads that create a digital wallet to
purchase and/or store your cryptocurrency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"inherit",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=192 height=350 id="image058 - Blockchain wallet application"
src="https://github.com/bbauska/LFS170x-2021/blob/main/images/image058.png?raw=true"
alt="Bitcoin Wallet Application"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"inherit",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is worth mentioning here that cryptocurrencies are a
function of a particular blockchain, the Bitcoin blockchain only transacts
bitcoin and the Ethereum blockchain can only exchange Ether. To initiate the
transaction, Alicia would make a request of the system to send Bitcoin to
Billy’s wallet by specifying the amount and Billy’s Bitcoin address.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Step 2: Smart Contract Triggered</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Alicia sends her transaction to the network, it
triggers a smart contract that checks with the nodes on the network to make
sure Alicia has the currency to spend, and that she hasn't already spent it.
Once checked, the transaction is added to a proposed block.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Step 3: Operators Spread Transaction</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Proposed block is communicated to the network through the
peer-to-peer protocols.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Step 4: Consensus</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order for the Bitcoin network to validate a block, nodes
or miners must validate the correctness of a block by completing a math problem
first. The node that completes the Proof of Work equation first is rewarded
with some newly minted Bitcoin. Once a solution for the equation is reached,
the other nodes can easily check its accuracy, thereby accepting the new block
onto the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Step 5: Spread The New Block</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This block is spread throughout the network through the same
peer-to-peer communications we used for the transaction. When block operators
receive a copy of the new block, they add it to their copy of the distributed
ledger. This guarantees that all members of the peer network agree on the
current state of the blockchain’s distributed ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Step 6: Transaction Completed</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The user’s wallet monitors for the creation of new blocks
that include transactions associated with the user. When a block containing the
completed code from the user’s operation is received, an event is created to
notify the user that the operation is complete. When the block containing
Alicia’s Bitcoin transfer to Billy is added to the blockchain, an alert will be
sent to the affected wallets that the transaction was accepted and completed.</p>

<h2>Consensus in Blockchain</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Consensus in blockchain is
moving away from a centralized system where one entity keeps track of the
ledger towards a decentralized system where trust does not rest with one entity
but all entities and what they decide together. The blockchain is a distributed
and decentralized system, which means that it needs to have a way of tracking
the official current state of the system. Since the blockchain can include
financial transactions and business agreements, it is important that all
parties involved are in sync regarding the terms of the agreement.</span></p>

alt="Computers connected"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>In this section, we will discuss
the details of how a blockchain network comes to agreement on the contents of
the blockchain.</span></p>

<h2>Consensus</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the most important components to blockchain is this
idea of group consensus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we talked about in an earlier module, blockchain is
inherently a very inefficient system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We're asking multiple nodes, sometimes tens of thousands of
computer nodes, to all repeat the same work: they're all keeping a copy of the
same data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the reason we agree to this tremendous inefficiency is
because if we can get all or most of those nodes to agree on what the truth is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can have a lot of trust that that's actually the truth,
that that record hasn't been tampered or altered or changed in any way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consensus is one of the underpinnings of blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are several different methods we use right now to have
all these nodes reach consensus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Essentially, when we talk about consensus, you can think of
every block in a blockchain as being like a sheet of paper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's got a fixed amount of space. We write a transaction on
every line, and when that sheet of paper is full, it's important that we all,
as a group, come together and compare our different sheets and select the sheet
or the version of paper that the majority agree with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, there are several different methods that we use to
come to consensus on a block.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The oldest and most widespread method is what's called Proof
of Work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And you'll see in another module, we actually dive into
Proof of Work hands-on, and show you live what Proof of Work looks like and how
it actually works.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Proof of Work has served us well for the past nine, almost
ten years, got its start in Bitcoin, and it's used in every major public and
most private blockchain offerings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But we're also starting to see some of the limitations of
Proof of Work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the big limitations behind Proof of Work right now is
how big and how fast it can scale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Currently on Proof of Work blockchains, we're able to
process somewhere between 50 and 20 transactions worldwide per second, which
may sound like a lot until you realize that modern payment processing networks
like Visa can scale up to over 70,000 transactions a second.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, in order to compete with conventional technology,
blockchain really needs to add a few more orders of magnitude to that
transaction rate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are many proposed alternative consensus methods for
how we might be able to reach that kind of scale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are things in production right now like Tangle which
use a blockless solution, and they're also new and emerging consensus methods
like Proof of Stake, or Proof of Activity that we're currently examining to
take the work out of Proof of Work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We also have another module in this course where we talk
about Proof of Stake, and then another one where we compare Proof of Work versus
Proof of Stake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you're curious about any of the details of how these
consensus mechanisms are actually implemented, be sure to check out those
modules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the takeaway point to understand is that, it's this
consensus, it is this idea of asking all of these nodes, potentially tens of
thousands of nodes, to all repeat the same work and then periodically come
together and agree on whatever the majority select the right version of the
truth to be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That gives blockchain that high level of trust and that
makes it such a secure record store.</p>

blockchain is designed to be a shared, synchronized historical ledger, meaning

shouldn’t be included in the official record. Since blockchain is
decentralized, there is no &quot;higher authority&quot; that can rubber-stamp
and finalize the contents of a blockchain block.</span></em></p>

color:#454545'>, creator of the Bitcoin network, invented to achieve consensus
is based on scarcity. In one way or another, blockchain consensus algorithms
boil down to some kind of vote where the number of votes that a user has is
tied to the amount of a limited resource that is under the user’s control.
Based on the economic law of supply and demand, collecting enough of an asset
to have a controlling share will drive up the price of the asset enough to make
achieving that level of control unfeasibly expensive&quot;.</span></em></p>

<h2>Consensus Mechanisms</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to ensure no one spent the same Bitcoin twice,
Satoshi Nakamoto created the consensus algorithm called Proof of Work for the
Bitcoin network. Since then, several other consensus algorithms have been
invented to fit different use cases. These include Proof of Stake, Delegated
Proof of Stake, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance, and Proof of Elapsed Time.
The most commonly used consensus algorithms are Proof of Work and Proof of
Stake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><em><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:#454545'>&quot;In
Proof of Work, users in the blockchain network who want to create the next
block (and win the associated reward) are called miners. To win the right to
mine a block, miners race to find an acceptable solution to a “hard”
cryptographic problem. (...), “hard” mathematical problems can only be solved
by random guessing. When a miner finds an acceptable solution, they create a
block and broadcast it to the network, finalizing that block.</span></em></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><em><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:#454545'>Proof of
Work exploits the scarcity of computational resources by choosing a problem
that can only be solved by guessing. There is no limit on the number of guesses
that a miner can make at once. Proof of Work, therefore, incentivizes miners to
run as many mining machines as possible to maximize the probability that they
are the first to find a solution to the problem. Since mining computers take
money to purchase and money to run, the amount of control that a user can exert
over the blockchain is limited by the amount of money they have available to
invest in mining equipment&quot;.</span></em></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also, the process of mining requires computing power that
runs on electricity. Some argue the Bitcoin network is not sustainable because
of its increasing need for electricity. The argument against this assumes
Bitcoin miners are out to make a profit and by using renewable energy sources
to power the mining operations they will be more profitable. As a result of
seeking out carbon-friendly energy sources, mining companies will bring new
renewable energy solutions to the power grids.</p>

alt="Proof of Work"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>The security of the Proof of
Work consensus is based on the assumption that no one controls more than half

controls 51% of the mining effort, they control consensus. To take control
would require a huge investment in equipment and energy, more than would be gained
by defrauding the system.</span></p>

<h2>Proof of Stake</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Proof of Stake comes with a number of improvements to Proof
of Work systems, it requires less energy and has a lower barrier to entry since
no specialized hardware is required to create blocks.</p>

tokens they own. This gives them the opportunity to be selected as the next
user to create or &quot;forge&quot; a new block and earn the reward. A block
forger is pseudo-randomly selected from all of the users who have staked some
of their assets, and the selection process is biased based on the size of the

<h2>Fault Tolerance in the Blockchain</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In blockchain, it is essential all participants agree to the
state of the ledger. Shared decentralized ledgers arrive at network agreement
or the state of the ledger by consensus algorithms. But what happens if all
participants in the network don’t agree? Let's discuss the concept of Fault
tolerance and why it is an important blockchain concept.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As described by&nbsp;<a

is a distributed, decentralized system that maintains a shared state. While

alt="Byzantine Fault Tolerance"></p>

<h2>Fault Tolerance</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the things we've talked about extensively in this
series is how inefficient and redundant blockchain is and that is by design.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's what gives us immutability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And another thing it gives us is an extreme level of fault
tolerance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At its heart, blockchain runs on a peer-to-peer network
architecture in which every node is considered equal to every other node.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And unlike traditional client-server models, every node acts
as both a client and a server.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, we continue this redundancy down at the network
level, where we're asking all these nodes to perform the same work as all these
other nodes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like any peer-to-peer system, we have an extremely high
degree of fault tolerance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In fact, if we have two or more nodes online in a blockchain
system, we still have a working blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And when you think about that amazing fact given the scale
of major public blockchains, you can see the inbuilt fault tolerance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's look at Bitcoin for an example.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's a blockchain that consists of over 30 thousand nodes
coming to consensus on every block.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As long as we have two or more of those nodes online and
able to communicate, we still have a working solution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That gives us a tremendous margin for error, for nodes
coming and going offline, for network transport issues, and it makes blockchain
really, really a great platform to use in environments with less than ideal
networks and power infrastructure, because we can have nodes come offline, go
back online and when a node comes online after being offline for a while, all
it has to do is sync up, and get all the data that it missed while it's been
offline from all of its peers, and then it's right back online participating
like all the rest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is very different from the centralized systems that
blockchain aims to replace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a traditional client-server model, if that server is
offline, those clients have no way of getting the data that they requested or
performing the operations they'd like to perform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is not the case in blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if we look back historically at other peer-to-peer
solutions, solutions like Bittorrent or Napster, we've seen the tremendous
difficulty that authorities have had taking some of these networks offline.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is due to the fault tolerance you get from a
peer-to-peer architecture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In fact, we saw this recently during the Arab Spring, when
the Egyptian government decided one night to shut down Internet access for the
entire country.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, within 24 hours Egypt was back online and connected to
the Internet through a network-sharing mechanism known as mesh networking, which
at its heart is just a peer-to-peer method for sharing Internet connectivity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We know that peer-to-peer has a long history of providing
extremely high fault tolerance and reliability, and that's why we've chosen to
build a platform like blockchain on top of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you're looking for a solution platform that offers you
that kind of incredible fault tolerance, if you're looking to deploy a solution
into areas with less than ideal infrastructure or under conditions where nodes
may come online and go offline frequently, then blockchain may be a really good
platform to look at.</p>

<h2>Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>We've talked a lot in this course about Proof of Work versus
Proof of Stake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Proof of Work is the oldest and the original consensus
protocol. It's coming up on its tenth anniversary; first one into production
with Bitcoin back in 2009.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And as a consensus protocol, it served us very, very well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There have been a number of hacks and exploits that have
been committed against various smart contracts and solutions written on top of
the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But for almost a 10-year history with over half a trillion
dollar market cap, no one's been able to successfully exploit Proof of Work
itself, which really shows the security and the reliability of the protocol.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, there are some shortcomings and criticisms to Proof
of Work that are now leading us to look at alternative consensus mechanisms,
like Proof of Stake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of those is our transaction processing capability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On a good day, Proof of Work is capable of processing
anywhere between 10 and 20 transactions per second worldwide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This may sound like a lot, but it still leaves us a wide gap
to conventional processing powers, that something like Visa's payment processing
network which can scale up to over 70,000 transactions per second.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, in order for blockchain to continue to be a successful
solutions platform, we know that we're going to need to find other consensus
mechanisms, which allow us to scale up that transaction processing speed into a
range where we start to compete with conventional technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are also some other criticisms behind Proof of Work
that are leading us to alternative methods, like Proof of Stake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of those is the idea of centralization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you know from this course, one of the key tenants of
blockchain is the idea of decentralization, that no one central authority,
intermediary or participant, should ever have too much power or control in a
blockchain network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What we're seeing right now with Proof of Work is an arm's
race, where folks are competing with very various specialized pieces of
equipment, specialized hardware, specialized mining rigs, in order to mine most
efficiently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this can be done most efficiently in large data centers
where electricity is cheap.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Right now, almost 80% of the processing power behind the
Bitcoin network resides in six major data centers in mainland China.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of advocates and blockchain purists think that this is
far too much centralization in one geopolitical region of the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One way we aim to change that is through Proof of Stake,
where we remove the work component of group consensus and we replace it with a
very specialized form of gambling or wagering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The idea of being that if we no longer require specialized
hardware in order to come to consensus, we can allow anybody with any kind of
device to participate in consensus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That may be you at home with an old laptop, or a friend with
a smartphone, or a tablet, or an iPad, that sits on your nightstand most days
and doesn't get used.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This allows for a much wider and more decentralized range of
devices and potentially a much larger network size to participate in consensus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Speed and the idea of decentralization are big drivers
behind the move to Proof of Stake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And we're gonna see how well that works out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We'll see Proof of Stake finally go live in Ethereum later
this year (2018), certainly with more blockchains to follow if it becomes a
successful consensus mechanism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you hear the debate these days about Proof of Work
versus Proof of Stake, and you're trying to understand what do they mean and
why are we looking at transitioning from one to the other, understand that
we're just trying to overcome some of those big limitations behind Proof of
Work, the consensus mechanism that has served us so well to date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We're trying to find consensus mechanisms that most
importantly allow us to scale up, to get our transaction processing power on
par with conventional technology, and we're also trying to remove some of the
centralized aspects that we've seen form around Proof ofWork.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We talk about Proof of Work and Proof of Stake in much
greater depth in other modules in this course.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you're curious about the difference between them, how
they work and what the actual implementation differences are, be sure to check
out those other modules.</p>

<h2>Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's recap differences between Proof of Work and Proof of
Stake:</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Consensus Model</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Bitcoin, the first blockchain
to appear, uses Proof of Work which requires miners to solve a complex
cryptographic mathematical puzzle for which they get rewarded. Block rewards
are newly minted Bitcoin granted to the miners that solve the puzzle first.
Built into the Bitcoin blockchain protocol, is an event called halving.&nbsp;</span><a

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:#00688D;
background:white'>Bitcoin halving</span></a><span style='background:white'>&nbsp;happens
every four years and Bitcoin’s block reward gets cut in half. The halving
occurs when the block height reaches a certain point (210,000 blocks) which is
programmed into the protocol. The first halving occurred in November 2012 and
the block reward was cut from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. The second occurred July 9,
2016 and the reward was reduced to 12.5 BTC. The third occurred on May 11th
2020, cutting the block reward to 6.25. The next halving is estimated in the
year 2024 and the reward will be reduced to 3.125 BTC. The Bitcoin network is
programmed to produce only 21 million bitcoin and the halving is what keeps
inflation in check by slowing down the distribution. About </span><span

style='background:white'> of the 21 million BTC have been mined so far.</span></p>

<h2>Ethereum Consensus Model</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Ethereum currently uses Proof
of Work for a consensus model. Ethereum was introduced in a white paper
by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin"

improvement is expected sometime in the second half of 2021.</span></p>

<h2>Hyperledger Fabric Consensus Model</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hyperledger Fabric is a private permissioned blockchain
platform that breaks consensus into components, allowing users to pick a
consensus algorithm for their particular situation. Instead of a predetermined
consensus model, Hyperledger has an ordering service that performs consensus
related events, this ordering component can pick the consensus model that best
suits the blockchains needs. By approaching consensus in this modular fashion,
Hyperledger DLT’s can change consensus models without huge overhauls to the
code base.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As explained by&nbsp;<a
href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/blockchain-consensus-and-fault-tolerance-in-a-nutshell-765de83b8d03"
target="_blank"><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><em><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:#454545'>&quot;Hyperledger
Fabric deliberately avoided hard-coding a consensus mechanism into the protocol
by defining an “orderer component” that performs all of the consensus-related
operations. This allows users of Hyperledger Fabric to select a consensus
algorithm that fits their use case without being forced to make large-scale
code edits&quot;.</span></em></p>

<h2>Corda Consensus Model</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><a href="https://www.corda.net/" target="_blank"><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;color:#00688D'>Corda</span></a>&nbsp;is
a private permissioned blockchain. Each Corda network has a notary service made

applications called The Corda Business Network Toolkit to manage one or more
Corda networks. Corda does not follow the standard blockchain model of
transactions being bundled into blocks and then being finalized by the network
as a whole. Instead, a Corda network contains one or more notaries consisting
of several independent parties. Transactions in Corda are finalized by a notary
with a multiparty digital signature using an algorithm like Raft.</p>

<h1>Chapter 4: Blockchains and Governance</h1>

<h2>Chapter Overview</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this section, we will cover blockchain governance. We
will start by discussing the cooperative way blockchain companies share the
computer code for this technology. We will also&nbsp;explore how this open
source environment is fostering new innovations. And then we will examine who
really is in charge of blockchains and how the network effect determines the
direction a blockchain will take.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, we will&nbsp;take a look at how these trustless
systems with open interactions are more secure than past systems. Finally, we will
dive into the idea of collaboration among parties who don't trust each other
and how blockchain technology is changing how the global community can
interact. This new form of world wide collaboration can be the key to solving
the world's toughest problems.</p>

<h2>What Is Open Source?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain technology and the developers who work with it
reinforce the basic tenet of decentralization in many ways. Not only by
decision making consensus models, but also the way in which it distributes the
software code.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Proprietary/closed source code<br>
Software controlled by the person, team or organization who created it and
maintains exclusive rights over it. Only the original authors can legally copy,
inspect, and alter the software. Most users of proprietary software sign an
agreement giving permission to use the software but not alter it. Microsoft
Office is an example of proprietary software.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Open source code<br>
Computer code that describes a specific approach to creating software. When
describing tools for distributing open source code Discipline Tools states,
Open source initiatives embrace and celebrate principles of open exchange,
collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency and
community-oriented development. Open source software is code that anyone can
inspect, modify and enhance. Much of the Internet was built on open source
technologies. Users of the computer software never interact with the source
code, rather it's manipulated by programmers who improve and fix it. As with
proprietary software, users must accept the terms of the license, but they are
dramatically different structurally. Linux and Kubernetes are examples of open
source software.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Open source software fosters collaboration by sharing code
and encouraging modifications and improvements. Instead of charging for the
software program, software developers find it more lucrative to charge for
service around developing and maintaining these open source projects.</p>

<h2>Benefits from Open Source Software</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Developing software in an open source environment means a
willingness to share and collaborate in a transparent way.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control<br>
To a developer's open source means an individual can contribute to the
direction the code takes. This open participation means coders who participate
the most have more influence over the direction of the code.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Training<br>
The ability to copy code and make your own changes in test environments act as
invaluable hands-on training. This also fosters innovation as programmers can
devise previously unthought-of functionality and code direction.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Security<br>
In open source, software programs are considered more secure because they are
open to peer review where errors can be spotted. Coders are encouraged to test
code, find errors and develop fixes to bugs as long as they follow the process
the network has in place.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Stability<br>
Open source projects have a certain amount of code stability due to the openness
for public review. A publicly distributed source code is openly reviewed and
can expose situations that may not have otherwise been tested.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Community<br>
Open source inspires the community to get involved. When contributing to an
open source project, you join a community of people that ultimately affects the
software you are interested in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The programming code for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger and
other blockchains is open source.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Governance</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Humans are tribal by nature, we tend to attract each other
and build tribes, villages, towns, cities, states and countries. With these
interactions comes a need to direct the behavior of the group. These directions
become the social norms among those who are living with or near each other.
These norms become the rules by which the behavior of the group is governed. It
doesn’t matter if the governance is the real world or the digital world, there
are shared underlying principles within both. Let's take a look at who is
involved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"inherit",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=384 height=320 id="image066 - Participants in governance"
src="https://github.com/bbauska/LFS170x-2021/blob/main/images/image066.png?raw=true"
alt="Participants in Governance"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Governance can be undertaken by a government, market,
network, organization, social system or family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a governance process to work effectively, the above
three principles will need to agree to the rules that govern the behavior. The
rules should be aligned with the overall participants' goals, and the leaders
should have the ability to enforce positive and negative actions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now that we have a simple understanding of governance, let’s
analyze how this is taking place in both the standard world and the blockchain
world.</p>

<h2>Governance Explained</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every business wants to make sure it's getting the best out
of technology spending.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IT governance is a formal framework that provides a
structure for organizations to ensure that technology investments support
business objectives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we all know that, despite our best efforts, things
occasionally do go wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A large part of modern governance efforts includes planning
for disasters in a way that ensures business continuity - the ability to remain
available to customers no matter what.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Modern decentralized solutions are most often created in a
cooperative or consortium format - a shared joint effort business
organizations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In these initiatives, it is important not only for clear and
comprehensive governance to be in place, but for that governance to be
consistent across participating organizations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These type of cross-organizational governance efforts
represent an entirely new type of project initiative, and will require business
analysts, solution architects, product and program managers, and executive
leaders who understand the incredible potential and massive disruption that
decentralized solution architectures bring to focus.</p>

<h2>Governance Models</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>A basic description of governance can be defined as a system
by which behavior is directed. This direction is guided by a set of norms or
rules and a way to enforce or keep order. The mechanism to enforce these
policies can take many forms from a dictator who has complete control to a
democratic governance model where the voice of the majority is recognized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"inherit",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=384 height=87 id="image067 - Governance models"
src="https://github.com/bbauska/LFS170x-2021/blob/main/images/image067.png?raw=true"
alt="Governance Models"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"inherit",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain governance models reflect a more democratic
flavor due to the open source environment. Blockchains are composed of a
community of users who work together to strengthen the system. The degree in
which the majority rules can vary.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Representative democracy<br>
This type of governance has a few individuals, empowered by the group, to
suggest new rules and guide future direction. The amount of authority the
representative has is granted by the majority. The representatives selected
reflect the views of the majority and are given authority to guide the
community. The control comes from the community and representatives are
presumed to act in the best interest of the governed. This type of governance
is more efficient as only a few debate the issue and decide on policy. Issues
can occur when the majority opinion unevenly reflects the community, causing
minority groups to be underserved. Also the assumption is that the
representatives are acting on the best behalf of the group and not in their own
best interests.</p>

All decisions regarding the governance of the group are voted on by the entire
community. In this form of governance model every vote counts and people have
more control over the quality of policies. In this model it is best to have an
educated community where everyone is willing to participate for the good of the
whole.</p>

<h2>How Does Blockchain Fit Into Governance?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each and every blockchain ecosystem that has or is being
created will need some kind of governance mechanism in place. As discussed in
the&nbsp;<a

color:#00688D'>“Bitcoin and Blockchain Governance: What It Is and Why It
Matters”</span></i></a>&nbsp;article by Evan Karnoupakis, traditional systems
and laws are made and then enforced. When participants (miners, developers, and
users) in the network are interacting, ideally they are acting in a way that’s
best for the overall group. Being able to build a governance structure in a
decentralized (sometimes anonymous, as well) world has proven to be extremely
difficult, but this is a problem that many DLT companies are in the midst of
solving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most governance structures in the blockchain ecosystem are
looking to achieve similar goals, such as:</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Using pooled funds for research and development.</p>

<h2>On-Chain vs. Off-Chain Governance</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>These goals can be achieved through many different methods
of governance. When designing a blockchain, choices between on-chain and
off-chain governance must be balanced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the on-chain governance, rules for instituting changes
are encoded into the blockchain protocol. This means that any decision being made
is automatically being translated into code (e.g. decisions concerning block
size). Developers propose changes through code updates and each node votes on
whether to accept or reject the proposed change.</p>

Senate, developers submit a pull request to the community, the miners take the

practice. Lastly, the users are just like citizens in a nation or state and can

<h2>What Is Blockchain Governance?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the previous chapter, we discussed the decentralized
characteristics of blockchains. But if blockchains are decentralized, how are
decisions made and by who? Open source software organizations and open source
software development projects need a way to manage projects. Most organizations
are centralized and have a set leadership team. Before getting into the details
of how governance works on the blockchain, it’s important to have a clear
definition of what blockchain governance is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order for a blockchain to survive, it must adapt to the
needs of its users and advances in technology. The way the changes are debated
and decided upon is important for these decisions to be implemented. A
decentralized ecosystem is designed not to be under the control of a single
source, there is no CEO to take responsibility for issues. This means
blockchains need a new strategy for governing the policy it wants to adopt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Strategies must include incentives so the members want to be
good actors in the system. The efforts of the group must be coordinated to be
productive. Both of these elements are necessary in blockchain governance
models.</p>

<h2>Blockchain Governance Strategies</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several different blockchain governance strategies have been
proposed and implemented for different blockchains. Let's review some
blockchain governance strategies sorted from the fewest to the most members
directly involved in the decision, as discussed in the&nbsp;<a

are stored on the blockchain itself. These regulations typically are
implemented as smart contracts on the blockchain with built-in methods for
users to modify the rules based upon their needs and the needs of the
blockchain&quot;.</span></em></p>

<h2>Consortium Governance</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Due to blockchains built in trust and collaboration
mechanisms, new pathways are opening up for enterprises to work together. A new
form of collaboration fostered by blockchain is consortiums. Consortium, as
defined by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consortium"

color:#00688D'>Webster's dictionary</span></a>, is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><em><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;
color:#454545'>&quot;an agreement, combination, or group (as of companies)
formed to undertake an enterprise beyond the resources of any one member&quot;.</span></em></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most enterprise blockchain solutions will be implemented by
a &quot;consortium&quot; of enterprises, building one or more applications on
top of a &quot;blockchain platform&quot;. These consortiums are already forming
in many industries to deal with the particular problems of those industries.
Alliances in Trade Finance, Carbon Emissions Accounting, Social Impact and
Healthcare have working blockchain consortiums solutions.</p>

<h2>Who Really Governs the Blockchain?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain governance comes down to the users. For a
blockchain community to thrive it needs a robust community. Changes to the
operation of the blockchain must be accepted by the majority of its users or
they will create a new blockchain that does. The process by which changes are
made follow these five steps discussed by Pierre Rochard in his article&nbsp;<a

alt="Process of Blockchain Governance"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The changes to a blockchain starts with research. Before the
problem or situation can be addressed it must be understood. A proposal
consists of a problem definition and a proposed solution. Implementation
requires a little bit more work as the nodes and user must agree to the change
or it can not be enforced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As explained in the&nbsp;<a

by Demiro Massessi:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><em><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:#454545'>&quot;Major
changes to a blockchain require a hard fork. A hard fork is a change to the blockchain
protocol that makes it incompatible with old clients.</span></em></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><em><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:#454545'>For a
hard fork to be successful, users need to agree to follow it.&nbsp;Users can

Fork on Ethereum created Ethereum Classic.</span></em></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><em><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:#454545'>Despite
the official story of who governs the blockchain, in the end, the users are the
ones who really make the final decisions of what will or will not be included

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><em><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:#454545'>Any major
change to a blockchain requires a &quot;hard fork&quot;. All this means is that
the blockchain protocol has changes that are not backward compatible, so
blockchain clients that do not make the switch will not be able to operate on
the main blockchain. A soft fork is a change that invalidates previous valid
blocks by accepting new blocks, soft forks are backwards compatible. For a hard
fork to be successful, users of the blockchain need to make the decision to
update their software protocols to incorporate the new changes.</span></em></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><em><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:#454545'>If not
all users decide to make the switch after a hard fork, a divergent blockchain

implement a hard fork doesn’t cause the old version of the blockchain to become
non-functional. Users who choose not to follow the fork can decide to maintain
the old blockchain, fragmenting the blockchain network&quot;.</span></em></p>

<h2>Bitcoin Network and Governance</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>As we mentioned in previous
sections, Bitcoin uses a Proof of Work model to encourage miners to add blocks
to the network. This governs the operations of the blockchain. But what happens
when changes need to be made? How do they get implemented? The Bitcoin
community consists of three main players:&nbsp;</span><em><span
style='font-family:"Bahnschrift",sans-serif;color:black;background:white'>developers</span></em><span
style='background:white'>,&nbsp;</span><em><span style='font-family:"Bahnschrift",sans-serif;
color:black;background:white'>miners</span></em><span style='background:white'>,
and&nbsp;</span><em><span style='font-family:"Bahnschrift",sans-serif;
color:black;background:white'>users</span></em><span style='background:white'>.
None of these participants have the ability to make emergency decisions when
unexpected situations occur. Bitcoin uses an off-chain governance model where
decisions are balanced by the developers, miners and users. In blockchain,
developers must write the code to change the blockchain. Without the consent of
the miners and users, the developers have no way of enforcing the change.
Miners and users must choose to adopt the new software changes.</span></p>

<h2>Bitcoin Improvement Protocols (BIP)</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a change to the Bitcoin protocol is needed, developers
will share the proposed change with other protocol developers. This improvement
sharing could be in the form of an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a
formal white paper, and/or a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP). Code is
written and tested that will enact the change. If developers in the community
approve the proposals and resulting code, the proposal is put to a vote on
chain and the miners decide if the proposal is implemented. This occurs through
a hard or soft fork.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This system is not without faults, as can be seen with the
SegWit improvement protocol which alters block size. The vision surrounding
blockchains deals with decentralization. By implementing the SegWit changes, a
change in how the Bitcoin blockchain protocol operates, a central authority was
responsible for enacting the change. To many in the community this decision
went against the fundamental tenets of blockchains decentralized philosophy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a result, the Bitcoin community was torn and the Bitcoin
Network split into two different chains Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Classic
(BCH).&nbsp;<a href="https://bitcoinfoundation.org/" target="_blank"><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;color:#00688D'>The Bitcoin
Foundation</span></a>&nbsp;is set up to educate and promote the Bitcoin
Blockchain.</p>

<h2>Governance in Ethereum</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Vitalik Buterin first
described the concept of Ethereum through a&nbsp;</span><a
href="https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/" target="_blank"><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:#00688D;
background:white'>Whitepaper</span></a><span style='background:white'>&nbsp;introduced
at the Bitcoin Convention in Miami 2014. It was based on the code for Bitcoin,
but included a logic engine that could execute smart contracts. By connecting computers
using the Ethereum blockchain, computing power is aggregated creating the
Ethereum Virtual Machine. Ethereum is not only a functioning blockchain with
smart contract capabilities, but a platform for new blockchains to be built
upon. The EVM computing does not come free, a GAS price is charged for the GAS
needed to perform the transaction’s computations. This GAS fee can change
dramatically depending on network conditions as the current price of Ether is
part of the calculation.</span></p>

<h2>Ethereum Improvement Proposals EIP’s</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like Bitcoin, Ethereum's three main players (developer,
miners and users) must update code to improve on functionality.&nbsp;<a
href="https://ethereum.org/en/eips/" target="_blank"><span style='font-size:
13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;color:#00688D'>Ethereum Improvement
Proposals (EIPs)</span></a>&nbsp;are standards specifying potential new
features or processes for Ethereum. EIPs contain technical specifications for
the proposed changes and act as the “source of truth” for the community. A note
worth EIP was the code for issuing a token. The&nbsp;<a
href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/"
target="_blank"><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;
color:#00688D'>Ethereum Request for Comment, ERC-20</span></a>&nbsp;introduced
the standards for issuing utility tokens on blockchain based on Ethereum
protocols. The&nbsp;<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain/"
target="_blank"><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;
color:#00688D'>Beacon Chain</span></a>&nbsp;introduced the Proof of Stake
consensus model and the concept of&nbsp;<em><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:#454545'>sharding</span></em>. Sharding is
the concept of running parallel side chains to alleviate congestion of the
network. The&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.coindesk.com/berlin-hard-fork-is-now-live-on-ethereum"
target="_blank"><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;
color:#00688D'>Berlin Hard</span></a>&nbsp;fork and the&nbsp;<a

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;color:#00688D'>London Fork</span></a>&nbsp;are
improvements to stabilize fees paid to the miners so these fees do not
fluctuate with the price of Ether.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ultimately, Ethereum uses the benevolent dictator for life
mode of blockchain governance. While user input and input from the development
team is welcome for Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin is the final authority on
decisions regarding the Ethereum roadmap.</p>

<h2>DAO Hard Fork on Ethereum</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>One famous example of this type of fragmentation is the DAO
hack on the Ethereum network. The DAO was an Ethereum smart contract that
completed a record-breaking crowdfunding campaign on the Ethereum network, with
all of this value stored within the DAO smart contract. A flaw in the smart
contract’s code allowed an attacker to create another version of the smart
contract under their control and siphon off a portion of the DAO contract’s
funds, worth roughly 72 million dollars at the time. After much debate, the
Ethereum network decided to implement a hard fork that allowed investors of the
DAO to reclaim their stolen Ether.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This was a very contentious decision, because the historical
ledger in the blockchain is supposed to be immutable and all transactions are
final. Smart contracts are supposed to be their own final authority, so any
action that could be performed with a smart contract, including exploiting a
programming flaw to drain value from it, is considered fair game. The Ethereum
network’s decision to reverse the DAO hack went against the principles of
blockchain’s immutability and the supposed self-regulation of smart contracts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of the Ethereum network refused to follow the DAO hard
fork, resulting in a divergent blockchain where the DAO hack was successful.
This created the Ethereum Classic cryptocurrency, which shares the same history
as Ethereum up to the DAO hack, but is completely independent after that point.</p>

<h2>Governance With Autonomy - Driverless Cars</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's discuss governance with autonomy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's jump 20 to 25 years into the future and see where
we've gotten with AI and autonomous drive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Driverless cars have now evolved to the point where a
company can own a fleet of autonomous vehicles all driving in a variety of
directions, moving items as well as people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But it's more than just that. Each car is pre-programmed
with a set of guiding principles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, don't hurt humans, reach X percentage of
profits within the month, maintain a set percentage of holistic health, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consider the following scenario: A vehicle arrives to pick
up a passenger for transport within a set time frame to take them to their
scheduled meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The passenger is running late and therefore decides to take
advantage of the option to pay an extra fee for an expedited route.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Conceivable solutions to provide this options could include
designating a lane on the highway for users paying the premium or sending
micropayments to other vehicles in exchange for adjusting their travels to
create a clear path for the expedited vehicle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once the passenger has been delivered to the appropriate
destination, the vehicle recognizes the need for maintenance after running an
internal diagnostic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After repairs are completed, the vehicle heads off to a
charging station and then moves on to the next customer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This can eventually be applied to blockchain governance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>More specifically, decentralized autonomous organizations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a concept that quickly manifested itself after the
Bitcoin white paper spread and people began to run through thought exercises.</p>

<h2>Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>An organization whose operating rules are encoded into a
computer program controlled by its members. It is composed of a complex stack
of smart contracts that form a decentralized application (Dapp).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In simple terms, a DAO is an organization that runs on a
stack of computer programs (called smart contracts in the blockchain world)
that are all interconnected to maintain a set of pre-programmed rules that have
been previously voted upon by a community. When thinking about regular
corporations stripped all the way down to their bare bones, they are basically
different groups following rules, responsibilities, and duties given from those
sitting at the top of the organization. The bigger they are, the more complex these
pieces become. At the moment, a DAO's goal is to automate this complex system
piece by piece.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within each DAO, there is a kind of pooling process for
humans to contribute new rules into the system. These rules are then presented
to the community and voted upon, based on the DAOs previously created rules.
These new rule commitments will need majority agreement (may be different for
each DAO) from the community to make this rule real. If this new computer-coded
rule is accepted by the community, then it will be placed into the stack of
other computer coded rules to improve the overall autonomous organization.</p>

<h2>Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>As our technology advances, the world around us becomes more
and more automated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Take securities trading, for example.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the 1950s, experts began designing the algorithm and
rules that an automated trading system should follow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the 1980s, technology began catching up and those
algorithms could finally start to be implemented.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Systems improved in the 1990s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And in 2008, the world's first fully automated trading
system, Betterment, went live.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just six short years later, more than 75% of shares traded
on US exchanges were made by fully automated systems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue to use technology to automate more and more
of our business processes, the concept of a DAO, or a Decentralized Autonomous
Organization, has emerged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The basic idea behind a DAO is simple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most business processes are governed by a set of
well-defined rules and procedures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These rules and procedures can be codified as smart
contracts on a decentralized network, thus, automating business process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This decentralized nature of Web 3.0 technologies like
blockchain makes it much more fault-tolerant, as well as providing a built-in
layer of redundancy, backup and error correction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consider the following example set sometime in the near
future, when fully autonomous vehicles and consumer grade artificial narrow
intelligence are common.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An entrepreneur notices a lack of ride-sharing services
available in her town and decides to enter the market.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She saves enough capital to purchase a fully automated
vehicle, as well as an AI Deep Learning system to analyze traffic and demand
patterns and design optimal routes for the vehicle to cover.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, over time, this single vehicle earns enough to fund the
purchase of a second automated vehicle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The business is able to manage its own operations,
forecasting and modeling, and grow with little to no human intervention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the conceptually ideal model of a DAO.</p>

<h2>Governance for Enterprise</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>We’re focusing on governance in the consortium space, not
governance within an enterprise company. So what is a &quot;consortium&quot;? A
consortium is just a grouping of institutions (possibly individuals) getting
together to achieve a mutual goal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This goal can be setting some standards for their industry
(Department of Justice), selling products (Airbus), sharing resources
(Universities), etc. In a consortium, the only real obligation you have to
others who are taking part would be providing resources for specific tasks and
sticking to the rules laid out prior to you joining. Within blockchain, there
are many different industries creating their own consortiums, such as financial
services, life science and health care, energy, media and telcos, and the
public sector.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Governance becomes much easier when it’s in a controlled
environment, with each member agreeing upon set rules prior to jumping in with
everyone else. Governance structures vary by industry and profit vs.
non-profit, so there will be no set governance model everyone uses, but there
are two we’ve come across in the blockchain space:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>One is including the formation of smaller subgroups to work on
specific issues.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The second is providing several levels of potential engagement,
ranging from participation in monthly calls to active technology development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The point we would like to get across here is that a
consortium governance model is currently more efficient than most decentralized
blockchains.</p>

<h2>Governance for Enterprise: Consortiums</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Almost all consortiums up to this point have been
permissioned and not decentralized permissionless blockchains, which is an
opportunity cost most companies make when joining. At a high level, a
permissioned blockchain is just that, a chain in which others must have
permission to operate on. So, all the nodes operating on a permissioned chain
have been verified by the central institution that is the authority of the
network and the transactions that are confirmed don’t necessarily have to go
through all the nodes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These consortium blockchains have historically taken two
approaches:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Business-focused consortia<br>
They aim to build and operate blockchain-based business platforms to solve a
specific business problem (e.g. Digital Trade Chain – focused on cross-border
payments).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Technology-focused consortia<br>
They seek to develop reusable blockchain platforms based on technical standards
(e.g. Hyperledger).</p>

<h2>Consortiums: Pros and Cons</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Let's see what are some pros
and cons of consortiums:</span></p>

<h2>Identity on the Blockchain</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this section, we're going to discuss identity on the
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's start by understanding why we even need to have an
identity on the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Centralized systems can be coerced by other forms of
authority to shut down their network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's take Napster for example.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Napster had a decentralized network architecture, but they
maintained the centralized authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Therefore, the central authority could be attacked and, by
taking out the central authority, could effectively control Napster.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is because Napster relied on that mix of centralized
control over a decentralized network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This impacted identity because you need an identity to
control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Torrents on the other hand, they do not operate in the same
fashion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Torrents provide a decentralized network with decentralized
authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This allows the nodes to manage identity differently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's also the reason why torrents are still being used
today, in spite of the entertainment industry's best efforts to stop it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Torrents remove the central authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, this begs the question &quot;Why didn't point-to-point
networks like torrents attain the same level of acclaim as blockchain?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because there's no guarantee that the nodes would do the
right thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nobody could guarantee that the nodes would cooperate with
each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This leads to an extremely important question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do you incentivize the nodes on the network to follow
the rules?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a torrent system, anyone can download and share a file,
but there's not a real incentive to be a good actor on the network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What happens when people do something dishonorable on a
torrent for instance, and stop seeding the files that ate up bandwidth or
occupied space on their computers?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Instead of music going to the network or other files, what
if it were money going through a point-to-point network, through a bank
network, let's say?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your transactions would never be processed reliably.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You couldn't trust that the processing was not messed up,
either deliberately or accidentally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Further, because of anonymity and the way that identity works
in the blockchain, you wouldn't have a way to punish or reward the actors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain solved this problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It perfectly incentivized how to create a decentralized
self-contained network using crypto economics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This differed from earlier point-to-point networks because
it offered economic incentives to the nodes that followed the rules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nodes are given money for following the rules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This money is in the form of cryptocurrency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The nodes were punished for tampering with the system or
with past transactions, or submitting a bad transaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is why all public blockchains can operate without an
authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is also the reason why cryptocurrency is mandatory for a
public blockchain, and not needed for a private blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because you need a way to incentivize the actors on the
network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consider how these rewards and these punishments work and
how a system without a central authority can determine what is valid and what
is invalid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the blockchain, identity is important.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You have to be able to prove that your assets actually
belong to you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Different blockchains they use different systems for
tracking identity and identity information, but most are based on the
principles of public key cryptography.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before we get into the details of how identity works on the
blockchain, we need to discuss the basics of public key cryptography.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The security of a public key cryptography it's based on
let's call them hard math problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, by that, I mean a hard math problem is one where it's
easy for someone to calculate it, but it's hard for someone to reverse that
calculation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Take multiplication, for example.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All things considered, multiplication is easy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have a little bit of time, something to write with,
you can pretty much multiply any two numbers and get the right answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A computer can do can do that even more quickly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Factoring on the other hand, it's hard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The best way to factor a large number is to try every
possible factor until you find the right one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, this approach works well if the number to be factored
is small.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It quickly becomes virtually impossible with a sufficiently
large factor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some public key cryptography algorithms are designed so that
breaking the algorithm requires factoring very large, usually prime numbers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another hard math problem used in public key cryptography is
based on exponents and logarithms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Exponents are easy, since it's essentially multiplication,
and logarithms are hard, since you're essentially factoring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most public key algorithms that use exponents use a type called
modular exponents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All this means is that when they're done calculating the
exponent, they divide the result by a publicly-known value called the modulus,
and they keep only the remainder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RSA is a commonly known public key cryptography algorithm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's based on exponents and logarithms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RSA uses the power law of exponents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What this means is that, if you take a number, you raise
that number to a power, and then raise the result to another power, that you'll
get the same result as if you simply multiply the two exponents together and
then raise the base to the result.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An RSA user chooses two exponents so that any number raised
to the product of the two exponents in a given modulus produces the original
number.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of these is called the public key and that public key is
distributed freely, while the other is the private key, which is intended to be
kept secret.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If someone wants to send a private message to the user, they
convert it to an integer using a publicly-known method.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They raise it to the power of the user's public exponent and
they send the result to the user.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The user raises the received value to their private exponent
producing the original message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RSA is secure because an attacker must be able to calculate
a logarithm to determine the secret message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since this takes guessing every possible value until the
correct one is found,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RSA is designed to make the number of potential values so
large that finding the right one is pretty close to impossible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another public key algorithm uses different math behind the
scenes, but the basics are effectively the same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A user creates a public key and the private key that can be
used together for either encryption or signing, which we'll talk about later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The algorithms are designed so that an authorized user only
has to do the, quote, &quot;easy calculations&quot;, while an attacker has to
perform the hard calculations, and the algorithm is designed to make attacking
so that the hard algorithms are close to impossible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Public key cryptography is how identity is handled on the
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A user's address on the blockchain it's their public key.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This has several useful properties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Users do not need to reveal their identity on the
blockchain, but they can positively identify themselves, since determining their
private keys requires solving a quote, &quot;hard problem&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anyone can send a user an encrypted message, since they have
easy access to their public key.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Users can verify the validity of their transactions using
digital signatures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can think of a digital signature as the opposite of an
encrypted message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In RSA, anyone can send an encrypted message to a user by
converting it to a number, raising it to their public exponent, and sending the
result to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The user's public and private keys are designed so that the
users can retrieve the original message by raising the received message to
their private exponent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RSA digital signatures involve the opposite process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A user writes a message and raises a condensed form of the
message to the power of their private exponent to create a signature, then they
publish that signature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Their public key and their message are both published
together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anyone can verify the signature using a simple three-step
process, condense the attached message using the same method as the message
writer, the message originator, raising that attached signature to the user's
public key, then verifying that the results of the previous two steps are
identical.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Digital signatures work for the same reason that encryption
works in RSA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An attacker needs to know the user's private key to perform
either operation, and the algorithm is designed to make that process difficult
or very close to impossible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This means that identity on the blockchain boils down to the
possession of a user's private key.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, it is absolutely important that that private key be kept
safe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Ethereum, a user's identity is managed using a public key
or address, and the user can use the corresponding private key to sign
transactions and read encrypted messages that are sent to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Hyperledger (Fabric) and Corda, identity is encoded in
x.509 certificates, which include the user's public key.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Corda, specifically, certificates can either be public,
which means that they are published to the blockchain, or confidential, meaning
that they are only shared with the parties that the owner performs transactions
with.</p>

<h2>Identity</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Self-sovereign identity and
blockchain solutions introduce identity management in a way that can improve a
system considered broken. This topic will be examined in the next chapter. In
this section, we will cover identity as seen through transactions and how and
if you want your identity tied to a transaction.</span></p>

<h2>Anonymity in the Blockchain</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this section, we'll discuss anonymity on the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Privacy and anonymity on the blockchain are a crucial part
of its success in some applications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If individuals or organizations are performing transactions
on the blockchain, they may not wish this to be public knowledge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Different blockchains have different levels of anonymity and
privacy built into the protocol.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As discussed earlier, public key cryptography is at the
center of maintaining identity on the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It uses a pair of public and private keys to make encryption
and digital signatures possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At this point, we need to take a look a bit more into the
relationship between a user's keys and a user's actual identity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first thing to consider is that there is nothing about a
public key that ties it to its corresponding private key.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We've said that a digital signature verifies that an owner of
the corresponding private key created the signature, but that is all that it
says.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since private keys are secret, obviously it can't be
possible for someone to determine a private key from a public key, at least it
shouldn't.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you know a user's private key, you can calculate the
public one, but the reverse is not true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other thing to keep in mind is that private keys are
just numbers, and can't be tied to a person's actual identity, their real-world
identity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Identity on the blockchain is just possession of the
relevant private key, and even if someone guesses or steals that private key,
they can't learn its owner's actual identity from it directly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The original blockchains did not have much in the way of
privacy and anonymity protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can't tie public keys to private keys or private keys to
real-world identities, which means that blockchain users have a limited amount
of built-in privacy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, every transaction on the blockchain is public and
stored there forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This means that a lot of information about the users'
identity could be learned through sifting through the data stored on the
blockchain to obtain the metadata.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Based on the repeated transactions to places like a coffee
shop or a market, someone could get an idea of where an individual lives and
their habits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For businesses, repeated transactions may indicate business
relationships that may lead to a loss of a competitive advantage if leaked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On basic blockchains, anonymity only goes so far.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The limited level of anonymity and privacy protections
available on the original blockchain has inspired development of enhancements
that increase privacy, while still allowing transactions to be verified and
validated publicly on the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is an incomplete list of some of the mechanisms
developed and implemented in various blockchains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We'll start with zero knowledge proofs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They use cryptography and cryptographic algorithms to allow
a user to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing the actual secret.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A common example of this type of proof includes a colorblind
person and two objects identical except for the color.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The colorblind person shows one object to the prover,
conceals both objects, and then shows one to the prover again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The prover then says whether or not they are the same
object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since the only way of determining this reliably is that the
objects are different colors, the prover can prove the difference in colors
without revealing the color of either object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another approach is stealth addresses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stealth addresses involve using one-time addresses to
perform transactions on the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A stealth address is just a one-time address that makes it
impossible to link a transaction to a known account.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What this does is prevents the data mining attacks on
privacy that we discussed earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We mentioned previously that transactions are digitally
signed .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With ring signatures, all that can be determined from a
transaction is that a member of a group signed it, but not the particular
member.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ability to see who is performing transactions with whom
is dangerous to user privacy and anonymity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Protocols like CoinJoin mix several transactions together,
so that it is difficult to pair senders with recipients.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Confidential transactions take advantage of homomorphic
encryption, which makes it possible to perform mathematical operations on
encrypted data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This means that the data contained in a transaction can be
hidden from the public, while still allowing the network to verify that the
transaction is valid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, let's discuss how different blockchains implement the
various privacy and anonymity mechanisms available.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We start with the Ethereum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ethereum does not currently implement many real advanced
options for privacy or and/or anonymity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the current version, user anonymity is limited to the
fact that no one can tie a public key to a real-world identity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is intended to change in the future though, and the
Ethereum roadmap currently includes laying the groundwork for implementing zero
knowledge proof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hyperledger (Fabric) provides several options for privacy
and anonymity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the lowest levels, users can achieve increased anonymity
through channels which can further encrypt the data that's stored on the
channel using keys only available to members of the channel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the next level, Hyperledger Fabric also allows users to
perform private transactions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a private transaction, data is stored on the cloud, but
the hash of the data is stored on the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This allows users to use the blockchain to ensure data
authenticity without storing the actual data publicly on the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, Hyperledger supports zero knowledge proof, where a
prover can demonstrate possession of some data without revealing the data
itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These different levels of privacy and anonymity protection
gives users a higher degree of configurability on the Hyperledger Fabric
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, Corda allows users to perform transactions either
as a party or an anonymous party on their blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An anonymous party has the same level of anonymity
protection as a basic blockchain, relying on the fact that public keys cannot
be tied directly to real-world identities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A party on the Corda blockchain reveals the real-world
identity of the user which intentionally sacrifices anonymity for identity validation.</p>

<h2>Advanced Blockchain Anonymity Techniques</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following are only some of the mechanisms developed and
implemented in various blockchains:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Zero-knowledge proofs<br>
Zero-knowledge proofs use cryptographic algorithms to allow a user to prove
knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret. A prover proves knowledge
of a secret without revealing it. New technology referred to as SNARK (Succinct
Non-interactive - ARgument of Knowledge) are fine tuning privacy issues on
blockchains.</p>

Stealth addresses involve using one-time addresses to perform transactions on a
blockchain. A stealth address is just a one-time address that makes it impossible
to link a transaction to a known account. This prevents the data mining attacks

signatures, all that can be determined from a transaction is that a member of a
group signed it, but not the particular member.</p>

</span></span>CoinJoin<br>
The ability to see who is performing transactions with whom is dangerous to
user privacy and anonymity. Protocols like CoinJoin mix several transactions
together so that it is difficult to pair senders with recipients.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span

<h2>Trust in Blockchains</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just as there are benefits with blockchain technology, there
are also some challenges. Blockchain is a culmination of technologies that have
been blended to provide a trustless platform. Expect some challenges and use
case justifications taking the old line of business apps to the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's recap the features of a blockchain that establishes
trust:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Blockchain technology is about storing some kind of data (which
are transactions in regards to the Bitcoin blockchain).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Blockchain is essentially transferring trust from an intermediary
to technology.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Storing data in the blockchain is through cryptographic
functions.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Private key/public key.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Collaboration through consensus.</p>

<h2>Establishing Trust in Blockchains</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>All transaction data on a chained block is assumed to be
trustworthy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The users base this trust on the fact that:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>This data has not been tampered with.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The blockchain is immutable.</p>

<h2>What Do Blockchains Really Do?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchains minimize the amount of trust required from any
single actor in the system. They do this by distributing trust among different
actors in the blockchain as defined by the consensus protocols.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchains have a shared ledger that gives us the absolute
truth of the state of the system. It uses mathematics, economics, and game
theory to incentivize all parties in the system to reach a “consensus” (i.e.
coming to an agreement on a single state of the ledger).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Consensus algorithms<br>
The blockchain is based on a consensus algorithm where all nodes agree that the
transaction is valid.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Financial transparency<br>
Financial transparency can reduce the need for intermediaries.</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Smart contracts<br>
Smart contracts reduce the need for accountants, lawyers, bankers, etc., as
computer code can replace some basic functions. Trust shifts to technology.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Trust in technology<br>
Trustless blockchains is a transfer of trust to technology from organizations,

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Confidential transactions<br>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Decentralized ledger<br>

<h1>Chapter 5 Overview</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now that we understand the basics of how blockchain works,
Chapter 5 will discuss the problems blockchain can solve. We will discuss the
concept of immutability and how the append only blockchain brings new trust in
shared information. Next, we will take what we learned about smart contracts to
see how they are bringing autonomy to systems that previously required human
interaction. We will discuss the double-spend issue and how blockchain can
solve for it. We will also discuss some popular cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, we will discuss the new business trends blockchain
makes possible. First, we will discuss the way we manage our identity and
information on the Internet and how decentralized identity solutions rooted on
a blockchain are fixing what is broken. Next, we will discuss how blockchain is
revolutionizing the financial markets by autonomous market solutions that
remove middlemen and open markets up to previously excluded clients. We will
also join in the conversation around Central Bank Digital currencies and how
enacting blockchain solutions can streamline the government's monetary
policies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, we will discuss the energized world of NFT’s
(non-fungible tokens) and how owning unique rights to everything from music,
sports collectables and even “captured moments” is turning the collectable
world upside down. We end the chapter with a brief discussion on
interoperability. In order for this new technology to take hold, blockchains
need to be able to communicate and transfer value amongst themselves.</p>

<h2>Immutability Defined</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Immutability is when
something is unable to be changed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=384 height=102 id="image072 - Immutability"
src="https://github.com/bbauska/LFS170x-2021/blob/main/images/image072.png?raw=true"
alt="Immutability"></p>

<h2>Immutability</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Immutable&quot; simply refers to the permanence of
data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anything we call &quot;immutable&quot; we understand to be
permanent and unchanging.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your local weather forecast - that's mutable, it changes all
the time; the stars in the sky, those are immutable, they seem permanent from
our perspective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the benefits of blockchain and many other Web 3.0
technologies is the promise of immutability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The data recorded on a blockchain system can never be
altered, edited, changed, or deleted once it has been recorded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As this data is stored in many different locations,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>changing or removing a copy of the data in one single place,
or in a limited number of places poses no threat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain goes further than this though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition to recording facts or data points, blockchain
also has the capacity to record who endorses or agrees with those recorded
facts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Think of the difference between a piece of paper, and a
contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A piece of paper can contain any data, true or not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A signed contract becomes more than a piece of paper because
those signatures represent who agreed with the facts recorded on the paper at
the time of signing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain provides a digital implementation&nbsp;of this
process,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and can be an immeasurably&nbsp;valuable tool when you need
to capture not only what happened, but who was involved as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Imagine the new opportunities that arise&nbsp;when
organizations can safely and securely share their most critical data with one
another, with the trust that the data they're seeing hasn't been compromised or
altered.</p>

<h2>Traditional Database Immutability Concept</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The very nature of centrally-operated databases can’t be
completely immutable, but that’s the case for blockchain as well. A
centrally-run database can embed things into it with features that mention
immutability (unchangeable). But if there is a central authority, they have all
the ability in the world to override that feature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another point to keep in mind is that immutability has been
around for many years, just like the majority of the tech used via blockchain;
it is the combination of these that makes it unique.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0

alt="Traditional Database Immutability Concept"></p>

<h2>Blockchain Immutability Concept</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's review the aspects of the public blockchain that
improve the chances of it being immutable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are many different variables, but the main one is
consensus. In a blockchain, it refers to the logs of transactions which are
created by consensus among the chain’s participants. The basic notion is that
once a blockchain transaction has received a sufficient level of validation and
posted on the chain, it can almost never be replaced, reversed or edited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If all the nodes within the network (Bitcoin specifically)
are working to solve a really hard math problem by running many computers
simultaneously, the chances of anyone overriding that are slim to zero.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But, if someone wanted to undermine the immutability of the
Bitcoin blockchain, here’s how they would do it:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>First, they would install more mining capacity than the rest of
the network put together, creating a so-called “51% attack”.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Second, instead of openly participating in the mining process,
they would mine their own “secret branch&quot;, containing whichever
transactions they approve and censoring the rest.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Finally, when the desired amount of time has passed, they would
anonymously broadcast their secret branch to the network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since the attacker has more mining power than the rest of
the network, their branch will contain more Proof of Work than the public one.
Every Bitcoin node will therefore switch over since the rules of Bitcoin state
that the more difficult branch wins. Any previously confirmed transactions not
in the secret branch will be reversed and the Bitcoin they spent could be sent
elsewhere. The computing power required to achieve this is enormous and
probably only theoretical, but it’s important to consider.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One other less technical and malicious example would be from
the Ethereum hard fork that directly happened after the DAO hack. In this
example, the majority of the Ethereum nodes in the network decided to update
the software preventing those hackers from withdrawing the cryptocurrency
“earned” (stolen). This update could not be enforced, since every Ethereum user
controls their own computer. Nonetheless, it was publicly supported by Vitalik
Buterin, Ethereum’s founder, as well as many other community leaders. As a
result, most users complied, and the blockchain with the new rules kept the
name &quot;Ethereum&quot;. A minority disagreed with the change and continued
the blockchain according to its original rules, earning the title &quot;Ethereum
Classic&quot;.</p>

<h2>Transparency Defined</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Anything that is see-through,
where there is very little fog or obstruction in the way. Just like
immutability, transparency comes on a spectrum. Certain things are more
transparent than others. In the context of business/technology, this can be
seen as a way of operating that is easy for others to see what actions are
being performed.</span></p>

<h2>Traditional CRUD Explanation</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before we jump into how blockchain technology can be seen as
transparent in certain aspects, let’s review the traditional CRUD method used
by most databases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"inherit",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=192 height=180 id="image075 - Update CRUD"
src="https://github.com/bbauska/LFS170x-2021/blob/main/images/image075.png?raw=true"
alt="Update CRUD"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a traditional database, a client can perform four
functions on data:&nbsp;<i>create</i>,&nbsp;<i>read</i>,&nbsp;<i>update</i>,&nbsp;<i>delete</i>.
In a traditional database, there is usually an administrator, the authority
giver who allows certain known participants in the database to do more than
read/create; it allows them to update (change) and/or delete.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Due to the fact that the administrator is controlling who
has access and who doesn’t, it’s easier to track these changes and prevent
actors from tampering. In the public blockchain world, this isn’t necessarily
the case.</p>

<h2>Blockchain Append-Only</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within the public blockchain world, every full node on the
network is its own administrator, where it can create (e.g. add) and read; this
is also known as read/write access (e.g. append-only). These nodes only add
more data over time in the form of blocks, but all previous data is permanently
stored and cannot be altered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Read: query (e.g. search) and retrieve data from the
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Write: add more data onto the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As explained in the&nbsp;<a

if the blockchain has recorded that my Bitcoin wallet has 1 million BTC, that
figure is permanently stored in the blockchain. When I spend 200,000 BTC, that
transaction is recorded onto the blockchain, bringing my balance to 800,000
BTC. However, since the blockchain can only be appended, my pre-transaction
balance of 1 million BTC also remains on the blockchain permanently, for those
who care to look. This is why the blockchain is often referred to as an
immutable and distributed ledger&quot;.</span></em></p>

<h1 style='margin:0in'><span style='color:#00262B'>Autonomy Defined</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Independence or freedom, the ability to make your own
decisions without being controlled by anyone else. This sense of freedom can be
at the macro level of a country or at the micro level of a person.</p>

alt="Autonomy in blockchain"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As children and adults, we all want a little autonomy in our
lives, careers, or relationships, but it’s just a matter of how much autonomy
one truly wants and can handle.</p>

<h2>Autonomy: Human Process-Driven Complexity</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The blockchain world is looking to solve all of this
complexity with autonomy from intermediaries via automated smart contracts. In
the traditional world of doing any kind of transaction with another party,
there tends to be a lot of administrative paperwork, with third parties
intervening every step of the way. Some of this is needed, but most of it
becomes wasted time and effort which could be spent elsewhere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=192 height=148 id="image077 - Book"
src="https://github.com/bbauska/LFS170x-2021/blob/main/images/image077.png?raw=true"
alt="Book"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Depending on how complex a transaction is between two
parties, designated specialists can make the process more efficient. Many
players are involved in the process, from contract drafters, signatories, and
regulators. If a dispute over the contract occurs, many parties can be
involved, including the courts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This complexity can be seen within many areas of life. Take
a moment to dissect the backend of certain services or products you use and
this concept will become exposed very quickly.</p>

<h2>Autonomy with Smart Contracts</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Autonomy in the blockchain world can be seen from many
different angles. We are going to focus solely on smart contracts in this
section, due to the amount of autonomy they provide everyone involved. The
concept of smart contracts has been around for a long time and was first
proposed by Nick Szabo, who coined the term in 1994.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The most simplified explanation is:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&quot;IF THEN ELSE&quot; statement, which means IF X
happens, THEN do Y, ELSE do Z.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Take this concept and apply it to two or more parties, all
interacting on a mutually agreed upon contract that executes based on their
actions (or non-actions). An example of a smart contract could be,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&quot;if this happens before the end of the year, then
you pay me, else I pay you&quot;.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These &quot;smart&quot; contracts aren’t very smart, at
least for now. That’s due to the simple explanation above because these
contracts are &quot;if, then, else&quot; statements, which can vary in
complexity based on how they’re stacked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the present moment, they can't make decisions without
human intervention, or AI, which is a highly debated topic at the moment by
many neuroscientists/philosophers. Companies are emerging as reliable Oracles
that filter in real world facts to the blockchain. An Oracle is defined as a
reliable source of information and blockchain makes that information immutable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anyone is able to create their own smart contracts without a
central authority giving the right to do so. These contracts are executed
without too much human intervention, and they’re stored on blockchain
technology which provides a sense of permanence. These are three of the main
attributes that can bring more autonomy to exchanging information between
parties. Setting up a pre-agreed upon contract that’s coded into a blockchain
and executes automatically when certain actions are taken is one step in the
direction of not only improving our autonomy as individuals or companies, but
shifting wasted resources (middle men/women) toward more impactful work.</p>

<h2>Smart Contracts</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first generation of blockchain platforms, collectively
known as the &quot;Blockchain 1.0&quot; networks, were capable of capturing and
recording data, but not acting upon it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bitcoin, the world's first mass-scale blockchain, was
designed to capture and record the transfer of Bitcoin from one owner to the
next. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the time, nobody was envisioning blockchain as a platform
on top of which applications and solutions could be built.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The release of Ethereum in 2015 changed this model.
&quot;Blockchain 2.0&quot; was born, and now blockchain networks could not only
capture data, they could act upon it as well. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All of this was made possible by the introduction of a
technology called &quot;Smart Contracts&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Put quite simply, a Smart Contract is some computer code
deployed to a blockchain network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Users can transact with the Smart Contract just as they
would another user, except when transacting with a Smart Contract, the rules
defined in the code are used to process the transaction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This advancement now allows blockchain solutions to manage
and automate processes, and record their results on a permanent, immutable,
secure ledger shared with all relevant parties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consider the sale of a used car. Alice lists her car for
sale, and offers a guarantee to any buyer that the car will be trouble-free for
1,000 miles. Bob looks at Alice's car and makes her an offer of $5,000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alice and Bob agree that Alice will take half the purchase
price now ($2,500), and the other half if the car has had no major issues in
the first 1,000 miles of Bob's ownership.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A Smart Contract could be created between Alice and Bob.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Smart Contract would hold the remaining $2,500 in
escrow, and if Bob had an issue with the car, he would report it to the Smart
Contract. After 1,000 miles the Smart Contract will determine how much of the
remaining funds are due to Alice and how much should be returned to Bob using
the rules Alice and Bob initially agreed upon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All details about the transaction would be recorded on a
permanent, decentralized ledger which could be used at any point in the future
to answer any questions about the transaction between Alice and Bob.</p>

<h2>Multi-Party Transactions</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our current world of transactions, there’s always a third
party to assist with connecting the sender and receiver. This has always been
the most efficient way to move something from Point A to Point B. But with a
third party making the connection comes the need to trust that they’ll get
whatever is being sent in an efficient, economical, and effective way. This
trust is open to human and process error. But we’ve discovered through
experimentation that certain use cases could be automated via smart contracts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"inherit",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=384 height=307 id="image078 - Multi-party transactions"
src="https://github.com/bbauska/LFS170x-2021/blob/main/images/image078.png?raw=true"
alt="Multi-Party Transactions"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One example is cross-border payments. Sending money from one
country (border) to another country (different border). The major issue with
how this is traditionally done today (e.g. correspondent banking) is that
certain transactions end up stopping off at 7–10 different checkpoint banks.
This constant stopping is making the money movement more expensive (each bank
takes a fee), slower, and less reliable (sometimes it might never make it).
This type of transaction is heavily reliant upon third parties to facilitate
the movement of information and money.</p>

<h2>Blockchain Multi-Party Sync (Removing Middlemen)</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain technology has been shown to provide many
benefits, but one of the most prominent and immediate benefits is removing
middlemen (third parties) from a variety of processes. There is a long list of
examples for middlemen currently being removed, such as:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Energy distributors</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Payment networks (Visa and Mastercard)</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Content distributors (YouTube, Facebook, Medium, etc.)</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Central exchanges (NASDAQ, London Stock Exchange, NYSE, etc.)</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Cloud database providers (AWS, Azure, etc.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How is the blockchain world removing this middleman? The
answer is all around trust. Within the public blockchain world, where everyone
is theoretically anonymous, there needs to be trust so we’re able to exchange
valuable things without the concern of bad actors. Trust is built into the
consensus mechanism that we’ve mentioned multiple times throughout this course.
This incentivizes all the participants to help secure and validate good actions
throughout the network. With that built-in &quot;trustless&quot; trust, we’re
able to remove those middlemen that provide no additional value, plus it could
potentially increase the efficiency based on which public blockchain is being
used.</p>

<h2>Cross Border Payments and Ledgers</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Traditional centralized ledger systems have weaknesses.
Accuracy is dependent on intermediaries who can change details of the
centralized ledger. Data derived from the ledger is siloed and misused.</p>

<h2>Double Spend</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bitcoin, the world's first blockchain, was created as part
of an attempt to create the world's first truly viable digital currency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bitcoin was not the first attempt to create a digital
currency, but it was the first which was able to successfully solve a
long-standing problem - the &quot;Double Spend&quot; problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Double Spend problem is quite simple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's say Alice owes a debt of $5 to both Bob and Carol.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alice's total debt is $10, but let's assume she only has $5
currently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If Alice's transactions were recorded on two separate
ledgers, it is possible that one ledger would show she paid $5 to Bob, while
the second ledger may show she paid $5 to Carol.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It would be impossible to tell who actually got paid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the double spend problem - any financial ledger MUST
prevent Alice from spending her $5 more than once.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Digital assets are particularly vulnerable to the double
spend problem as we generally design them to be easy to copy and distribute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you've got a great picture you took with your phone, it's
easy to post one copy to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Facebook, another copy to Instagram, then you might text a
copy to your spouse, and email a copy to your parents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We live in a world where digital assets are easy to copy and
distribute, by design.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A digital currency should NOT be easy to copy and distribute
though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was overcoming this technical challenge that lead to so
many failed attempts at digital currency before Bitcoin, and the innovations
that the solution to this problem has delivered are now being leveraged to
track and manage many different types of assets and data that we never could
easily manage before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is this possibility of building tools and solutions that
were never before thought possible that has so many people excited about the
blockchain revolution!</p>

<h2>Blockchain Solves The Double Spend Problem</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back in the early 1990’s, developers, cryptographers, and
different groups of people were trying to solve the double-spend problem as it
related to digital cash, previously known also as electronic cash. Double
spending within Bitcoin is the act of using the same bitcoins (digital money
files) more than once.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=288 height=158 id="image082 - Double spending problem"
src="https://github.com/bbauska/LFS170x-2021/blob/main/images/image082.png?raw=true"
alt="Double Spending Problem"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I buy an apple for $1, I cannot spend that same $1 to buy
an orange. If I could, money would be worthless since everyone would have
unlimited amounts and the scarcity that gives the currency value would
disappear. The network protects against double-spending by verifying each
recorded transaction within the blockchain utilizing a consensus mechanism
(explained in the previous section).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bitcoin was the first decentralized protocol to solve this
problem and now more protocols are following, such as: Proof of Stake (PoS),
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) structures,
Proof of Authority (PoA), etc.</p>

<h2>Digital Currency Difficulties</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today, when someone mentions digital currency, usually
Bitcoin or crypto is the first thing that comes to mind, but digital currency
had a long history before Bitcoin popularized it. This history goes all the way
back to 1983, when&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chaum"
target="_blank"><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;
color:#00688D'>David Chaum</span></a>&nbsp;introduced the idea of digital cash
in a research paper. Then, in 1992, he founded DigiCash, an electronic cash
company, which eventually went bankrupt in 1998 due to adoption (buyout by
another financial institution). Today, David is a leading pioneer of blockchain
companies such as&nbsp;<a href="https://xx.network/cmix" target="_blank"><span

provide scalable digital sovereignty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were many other attempts to create digital cash over
the years, but many failed due to a variety of reasons, such as:</p>

In keeping with the decentralization nature of the cryptocurrency markets,
exchanges exist where you are the custodian of your accounts and trading is
done from your computer or smartphone. This is where the term Decentralized
Finance was born. It gives you the ability to apply smart contracts to govern
your trades and access to markets previously only for accredited investors.

<h2>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</h2>

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:#454545'>&quot;Web
1.0 used centralized identity; Web 2.0 graduated to federated identity; now Web
3.0 is using decentralized digital identity, a model known as
&quot;self-sovereign identity&quot; or &quot;SSI&quot; because now individuals
control their own portable digital identity credentials in their own digital
wallets—just like we prove our identity with physical credentials from our
physical wallets every day. The digital signatures on these credentials use
blockchain technology for decentralized public key management. Finally we can
have a trust layer for the Internet that doesn't require everyone to rely on
centralized authorities&quot;.</span></em></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI) is based on the
idea that the Internet was created without a way to properly deal with
identifying participants. Innovative minds, such as Drummond Reed and Alex
Preukscha, have been working on solutions to this problem. We will start with
some key terms taken from the&nbsp;<a

Preukscha.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Internet was designed to identify computers, not users.
The result is a tangled web of passwords, and usernames, and siloed data that
is bought and sold without our consent. With blockchain and cryptographic
techniques, solutions are being developed to fix what is broken with identity
and the Internet. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>SSI is relatively new, having
only emerged onto the Internet stage in 2016. At one level, SSI is a set of principles
about how identity and personal data control should work across digital
networks. At another level, SSI is a set of technologies which build upon core
concepts in identity management, distributed computing, blockchain or
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), and cryptography.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span style='font-size:14.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;
color:#454545;font-weight:normal'>Verifiable credentials</span></strong></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The essence of decentralized
identity is transitioning physical identity credentials (birth certificate,
driver licenses, passports, college degrees, medical records, etc.) to a
digital twin that the individual can possess in a digital wallet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span style='font-size:14.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;
color:#454545;font-weight:normal'>Verifier</span></strong></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A verifier is the person,
organization or computer program granting verification of an assertion. They
request proof that a claim or statement about a credential is true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span style='font-size:14.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;
color:#454545;font-weight:normal'>Issuers</span></strong></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Issuers are the source of
credentials—every credential has an issuer. Most issuers are organizations such
as government agencies (passports), financial institutions (credit cards),
universities (degrees), corporations (employment credentials), NGOs (membership
cards), or churches (awards).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span style='font-size:14.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;
color:#454545;font-weight:normal'>Holders/Provers</span></strong></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Providers request verifiable
credentials from issuers, hold them in the holder’s digital wallet (below), and
present proofs of claims from one or more credentials when requested by
verifiers (and approved by the holder). Although we most commonly think of
individuals as holders/provers, holders/provers can also be organizations using
enterprise wallets, or things in the sense of the Internet of Things (IoT). The

<h2>Decentralized Finance</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to&nbsp;<a

target="_blank"><i><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;
color:#00688D'>&quot;The Complete Beginner's Guide to Decentralized Finance
(DeFi)&quot;</span></i></a>&nbsp;article by Binance Academy, Decentralized
Finance or DeFI refers to a system of financial software that enables financial
products to be made available to the public on decentralized blockchains. As we
have learned, the term decentralized and its ramifications will revolutionize
how we interact with each other. These new interactions can have different
effects in various sectors. In the financial markets, new interactions will
dramatically change the current structure by eliminating the need for
intermediaries. Banks, lending institutions, Money Managers, Market Analysts,
Hedge Fund Managers, and other positions and functions can now be performed
using smart contracts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With new technology platforms, open source projects are
fueled by blockchains, incentive models, stablecoins, smart contracts and self
hosted wallets that remove financial middlemen. Users' funds that are pooled
together for investment advantages are now managed by a series of smart
contracts that execute programmed financial trades instead of a third party.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Decentralized Finance</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Along with the new decentralized financial model come new
innovations that have far reaching ramifications. Microloans, smaller loans
made from pools of capital, now are available granting access to these
financial vehicles to participants previously excluded. For example, in
agriculture, farmers are able to secure small loans to help them get crops to
market.</p>

alt="Benefits of Decentralized Finance"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Regulating these new financial instruments is proving
challenging as government agencies wrestle with controlling currencies that do
not recognize borders. And have a steep learning curve. A stable price coupled
with the benefits of blockchain, new financial markets are emerging that will
change the current financial markets making them more inclusive.</p>

<h2>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC)</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Enterprise blockchain solutions are successfully creating
efficient micro-economies that are decentralized, immutable and efficient. The
success of these projects are forcing governments to take a look at blockchain
technology through the lens of streamlining current financial systems. More
specifically, studying how blockchain can improve the way governments handle
their central banking systems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Central Bank Digital currencies are a digital form of
central bank money that is issued by the central bank as part of its overall
monetary policy. In the Ledger Insights article titled&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/imf-pros-cons-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/"

color:#00688D'>&quot;IMF Outlines Pros and Cons of Central Bank Digital
Currency&quot;</span></i></a>&nbsp;it is estimated&nbsp;that 80% of central
banks are exploring CBDC.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of the benefits of Central Bank Digital Currencies
include:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Transparent monetary policy<br>
Due to the distributed ledger technology’s feature of transparency, creating a
digital currency will bring clarity to the government's monetary system, where
policy can be recorded on the blockchain and remain immutable.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Combat money laundering<br>
Money laundering is converting illegal funds into legal payments systems.
Blockchain can eliminate this practice with a shared ledger that keeps a
complete transaction history, making it impossible to erase. Like with all
money transfers, certain safeguards are in place to identify wallets or
accounts to users. Anti Money Laundering (AML) policies like Know Your Customer
(KYC) further ensure citizens are following laws in their countries.</p>

</span></span>Banking the unbanked<br>
To be unbanked describes a person who does not have a checking or savings
account. Being unbanked puts individuals at an extreme dis-advantage as they do
not have access to financial services like loans and usually pay more for check
cashing. By creating a digital currency governments can include this market
segment, onboarding people with mobile phones.</p>

<h2>Types of Central Bank Digital Currencies</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to the &quot;What Is Retail Central Bank Digital
Currency?&quot; article by Matthieu Saint Olive, there are two types of central
bank digital currencies:</p>

</span></span>Wholesale CBDC<br>
A wholesale CBCD is a type of currency used by financial institutions to buy
and sell financial assets. It would replace real time settlement systems used
today.</p>

</span></span>Retail CBDC<br>
Retail central bank digital currency would be used as a digital twin for fiat
currency. Citizens would use it to pay for things, send money and save it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Central Bank Digital Currencies are being considered across
the globe.</p>

<h2>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the beginning of this course we discussed the Internet
and the changes it has gone through. We started with Web 1.0 and how it
revolutionized the way exchanged value, looking back it is hard to believe we
managed without email. Then came Web 2.0&nbsp;and our social status and
personal information flowed on the net as freely as the air we breathe. Web 3.0
started with blockchain and the transfer of value, the first killer application
being Bitcoin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, you may be asking yourself,&nbsp;<em><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:#454545'>&quot;What's
next?&quot;</span></em>. That's where&nbsp;non-fungible tokens come into play
and are set to revolutionize art, music, sports and gaming by offering a new
kind of digital ownership and the ability to transfer unique value with digital
collectables. We first saw a glimpse of this new market with CryptoKitties but
let's look deeper into this phenomenon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token" target="_blank"><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;color:#00688D'>Wikipedia</span></a>,
a non-fungible token:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><em><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;
color:#454545'>&quot;is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called
blockchain, that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not
interchangeable&quot;.</span></em></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NFTs can represent art, music, videos and other digital
files where access to the original file is restricted, limited to the owner
proving authenticity and providence. The first standard for issuing NFT’s was
based on the Ethereum's&nbsp;<a href="http://erc721.org/" target="_blank"><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;color:#00688D'>ERC-721</span></a>&nbsp;that
differs from the ERC-20 as ERC-721 tokens are all unique which makes them
perfect for the collectibles market. The&nbsp;<a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155" target="_blank"><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;color:#00688D'>ECR-1155</span></a>&nbsp;aims
to improve on the previous token standard by further defining assets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's now take a look at some of the types of non-fungible
tokens:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Digital artwork<br>
By guaranteeing uniqueness of a digital item and applying smart contracts to
the terms of the sale, artists are now in control of the ownership rights to
their work giving control of royalties back to the creator. The New York Times
reported art entitled&nbsp;<a

artist Mike Winkelmann, also known as&nbsp;<a

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;color:#00688D'>Beeple</span></a>,
sold for $69.3 million USD in 2021.</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Collectables<br>
As we saw with CryptoKitties, non-fungible tokens create unique items. One of
the more popular collectables are&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/ethereum-eth-cryptopunks-nft-index-fund-migrates-to-sushiswap/"
target="_blank"><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;
color:#00688D'>CryptoPunks</span></a>, a collection of 10,000 uniquely
generated characters each having a unique owner registered on the Ethereum
blockchain. A crypto punk, Punk 1651 sold for 78 ETH or $136,850.22 USD.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Games<br>
NFTs can be used to represent assets in computerized games. With the ability to
trade assets created in a gaming platform, users and creators of assets in the
digital game can trade assets on a third party marketplaces and store them in a
wallet where the private keys are controlled by the gamer, taking control away
from the game developer.</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Music and film<br>
With NFTs, musicians and filmmakers can now tokenize their work where the
artist monetizes and profits from their content. When artists release music or
film as NFT, they retain control and realize royalties in a more equitable way.
Musicians can join in decentralized marketplace such as&nbsp;<a

font-family:"inherit",serif;color:#00688D'>Ujo</span></a>&nbsp;to ensure
artists are paid fairly, musicians enter into smart contracts that state
royalty stipulations without the need of a third party.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Sports<br>
The sports industry has embraced the idea of NFTs from tokenizing memorable
sporting moments to trading card collectables.&nbsp;<a
href="https://nbatopshot.com/" target="_blank"><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"inherit",serif;color:#00688D'>NBA Top Shots</span></a>&nbsp;being

In May 2021,&nbsp;<a

for the patent disclosure for two Nobel Prize-winning inventions dealing with
gene editing and Cancer Immunotherapies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The younger generation of collectors aren’t interested in
China sets and linen, but something they can show their friends on their social
media accounts. The future of the non-fungible token promises to be one of the
more energetic market segment blockchain has seen.</p>

<h2>Interoperability</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>To end this section, we must mention&nbsp;<em><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:#454545'>interoperability</span></em>.
Interoperability in blockchains deals with creating standards so different
types of blockchains can communicate with each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If new emerging blockchains can’t communicate with each
other, we will have the same issues with siloed data that created frustration
with the Internet of Today. As different blockchains take different approaches
to interoperability, standards will emerge that will help regulate the industry
and help with widespread adoption. Currently Hyperledger and Ethereum are
working together on interoperability projects from&nbsp;<a
href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/besu" target="_blank"><span

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;color:#00688D'>Hyperledger
labs</span></a>&nbsp;that deal with interoperability are working on standards
that will make it easier for blockchains to talk to each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When considering how blockchain interoperability can work,
consider email and smartphone. Both of these technologies have the ability to
interoperate. Outlook email server can receive email from the Gmail server and
Verizon cell phone carriers can transfer and accept calls from T-Mobile. These
services would not operate efficiently, if these companies couldn't exchange
data. With this in mind, blockchain are developing projects that, like
smartphones and emails, will transfer value and information across blockchain
seamlessly.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6 Overview</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This final section will examine blockchains in action. We
will see how blockchain is providing solutions for businesses, governments and
social projects. Businesses fueled by blockchain solutions are developing new
relationships for more efficient communication and trust among untrusting
parties, fostering new business models.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Governments are realizing the best way to serve the
population is to develop digital identity management systems where individuals
hold their credentials and services can instantly be matched to those in need.
We will discuss how governments are using blockchain to tackle document and
workflow management issues creating better services for their citizens.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, we will discuss the impact blockchain is having in
developing countries. We will look at examples of how philanthropy is offering
new transparency and accountability to charity organizations with massive
global benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then, we will devote some time discussing new technologies
and emerging breakthroughs developers are building. Either to enhance existing
systems or offering services to help users manage blockchains, these new
advances are like nothing we have seen before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, we will see use cases designed to improve the
individual's experience, decentralized gaming platforms and new marketplaces
inventing new worlds to interact in. Blockchains are reshaping the way artists
and musicians are benefiting from their creativity by having the royalties
delivered directly to them, without agents and middlemen.</p>

color:#00688D'>&quot;Digitizing Global Trade with Maersk and IBM&quot;</span></i></a>&nbsp;blog
post by Michael White.</p>

<h2>Supply Chain - Maersk</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Global trade functions much as it has since the introduction
of the shipping container in 1956.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Manual, paper-based processes are still common and
information about the status of goods is locked away in organizational silos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today, 90% of goods in global trade are carried by the
shipping industry with the supply chain slowed by the complexity and sheer
volume of point-to-point communication across a loosely coupled web of land
transportation providers, freight forwarders, customs brokers, governments,
ports, and ocean carriers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IBM and Maersk are addressing this problem with a
distributed permission platform accessible by the supply chain ecosystem
designed to exchange event data and handle document workflows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maersk and IBM are employing blockchain technology to create
a global tamperproof system for digitizing trade workflow and tracking
shipments end-to-end, eliminating frictions including costly point-to-point
communications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The collaboration will launch with the potential ability to
track millions of container journeys per year and integrate with customs
authorities on selected trade lanes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a recent test by Maersk, shipping a single container of
flowers from Kenya to the port of Rotterdam resulted in a stack of nearly 200
communications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Using this example, we will examine how blockchain has been
implemented to create trust and security in the digitized document workflow and
improve the efficiency of global supply chains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here we can see each distinct entity involved in the
transaction: the growers, export authorities, ports, customs, and importers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shipping from the port of Mombasa requires signatures from
three different agencies approving the export and six documents that describe
the origin, chemical treatments, quality of the produce, and customs duties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Firstly, using a PC or mobile device the Kenyan farm submits
a packing list that becomes visible to all participants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This action initiates a smart contract that enforces an
export approval workflow between the three agencies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As each agency signs, the status is updated for all to see.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Simultaneously, information about the inspection of the
flowers, the sealing of the refrigerated container, the pickup by the trucker,
and the approval from customs is communicated to the port of Mombasa allowing
them to prepare for the container.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All actions relating to the documents and the physical goods
are captured and shared: which documents were submitted, when and by whom,
where the flowers are, and who is in possession of them, and the next steps in
their journey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Flowers are perishable, so it's crucial that there are no
delays or missed steps .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain provides secure data exchange and a tamperproof
repository for these documents and shipping events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This system could significantly reduce delays and fraud
saving billions of dollars annually.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And, according to the WTO, reducing barriers within the
international supply chain could increase worldwide GDP by almost 5% and total
trade volume by 15%.</p>

<h2>Farm to Table</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Farms are complicated ecosystems with many moving parts,
careful timing, and seasonal financing structures. However, after the food
leaves a farm, it becomes part of a wide-reaching supply chain with a lot of
parties. Buyers, sellers, distributors, and grocery chains all want to know
where the food is along its journey. You also probably want to know where your
food has been before you serve it on your dinner table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The trend toward blockchain agriculture promises to make
each step of growing and distributing food simpler. It will offer all parties
involved a single source of truth for the agriculture supply chain.<span

color:#00688D'>&quot;How Walmart Brought Unprecedented Transparency to the Food
Supply Chain with Hyperledger Fabric&quot;</span></i></a>.</p>

<h2>Walmart</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>I purchased a pack of mangos, I came into my staff meeting,
I put them on the table, and I said: &quot;Your traceback exercise starts right
now&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And we timed how long it took them to get the information
for each point in the food system all the way back to the farm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And I'm not gonna give you the results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After the pilot, but it's gonna be good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a customer shops in our stores, we know they expect
great prices, we know they expect fast, clean, and friendly service, but an
unspoken expectation is that they expect the products that they buy in our
stores to be safe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You know, when there's a food event or a food scare what you
want to do is you want to be fast, but you want to be right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That food product is guilty until proven innocent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We at Walmart, will actually pull all the product until we
know what is the implicated product and can put then the safe product back out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And imagine, if we could pinpoint with certainty, within
minutes not days, that it was the implicated product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Walmart and IBM are working to make that a reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you think about the food system, it's pretty complex.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It involves farmers, processors, distributors, and the way
traceability is done today, each segment of the food system does it their own
way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most actually do it on paper or on systems that don't speak
to each other, and so you can never have a full view of what's happening in the
food system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What we hope to do with blockchain is bring all food safety
system stakeholders and collaborate so that we do it one best way, we can do it
very quickly, and efficiently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain is a digital ledger that allows different
segments of the food system to capture information about the product, what
they've done to it, where that product has been.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we're linking that data with other data points, the
Internet of Things, all that information will yield to insights that will allow
us to have a safer, more affordable and sustainable food system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But we don't believe traceability is the goal. We believe
that transparency is the ultimate goal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain will give us the ability to not only track where
food came from, but how it was produced, was it produced safely, was it
produced responsibly, is it sustainably grown, how many dates of shelf life are
left on that product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The food system is a shared responsibility and for
blockchain, and traceability, and transparency to work we need a lot of people
working together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We're excited to be working with IBM on this blockchain
initiative, but it's not just Walmart and IBM, we actually have some of our
suppliers participating in this pilot, we've got some universities also
participating in the pilot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We'll make sure that all stakeholders work together for a
safer and better food system.</p>

them digitally to opportunities to learn, equip and empower themselves. Through
the creation of a Financial and Social Inclusion platform, those Rohingya who
for years have been sidelined can be given access to a range of virtual

<h2>Identity</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Identity management is vital for blockchain operation.
Identifying objects that will interact with a blockchain such as people,
places, things (<a
href="https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/blockchain-and-iot-a-solid-technological-duo/"
target="_blank"><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;

when developing a blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One solution is the Verifiable Organizations Network (<a

font-family:"inherit",serif;color:#00688D'>VON</span></a>) project that enables
organizations—and the people running those organizations—to conduct business
online in a trusted manner. The core challenge is that on the Internet we can’t
tell if we’re talking to you, or someone pretending to be you. We need a
reliable way to verify that “you are you” in a manner appropriate for the type
of transaction that you want to complete and in a privacy-preserving manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Marketplaces exist to shop renewable energies to make
sustainable solutions available on open markets. Everyone knows there are
countless inefficiencies in the energy grid, stemming from the highly
centralized nature of our utilities systems. With the advent of at-home energy
production and storage through affordable solar panels and home batteries, many
users are storing energy surpluses at home without a way to “sell” clean
energy.</p>

<h2>What Is the Future of Blockchain?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is the future of blockchain?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is a big question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And unlike everything we have already talked about in this
course, this is nothing factual, but just my own opinion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think blockchain is a really, really exciting place right
now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain tends to get talked about in the context of a lot
of other exciting emerging technologies, things like IoT and smart devices,
self-driving cars and autonomous devices, AI, virtual and augmented reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The truth is, in my opinion, I see blockchain as an enabling
layer for many of these other technological revolutions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everybody is excited about the idea of smart devices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wouldn't it be great if I had a smart refrigerator that
automatically reordered more ketchup as it started to get low?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everyone gets a little nervous when it comes time to
actually talk about implementing something like this, because how do we protect
it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do we ensure that the data the system uses is immutable
and secure?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain provides that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think that we are going to see a lot of growth in emerging
technologies as blockchain continues to emerge, because it's going to make more
and more things possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if we talk long term, and again, only my opinion, I
think blockchain becomes the enabling layer for a multi-planetary human
economy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You might have seen earlier this year, February 2018, SpaceX
put up Falcon Heavy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because SpaceX and Elon Musk are committed to getting us to
Mars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And I truly believe in the next 20 to 50 years we are going
to see a human colony on Mars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, one interesting thing about Mars is that it's really
really far away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the closest Earth gets to Mars, it's a 26 minute
roundtrip at light speed, and there's two weeks out of every March and year,
where Earth and Mars can't communicate because the Sun is right in the middle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, think about this: if you run a small pizza shop on
Mars, you close out your register for the day, and you need to deposit funds
into your bank account, and that is a bank on Wall Street, New York City, and
under the best case scenario, that's a 26-minute roundtrip, you can see how
centralized models of the Internet aren't going to scale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, if you ask me, I really believe technologies like
blockchain and supporting technologies like IPFS are the enabling technologies
to allow humans to continue to trade and interact and conduct commerce with
each other when we become a multi-planetary society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that's why I think there's a ton of potential in
blockchain and it's something really exciting, and hopefully, you're all
inspired to stay up-to-date with.</p>
